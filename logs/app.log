            "speaker": "elements to it",
            "dialogue": "one is how do we deal with the emerging channels; and second is, what do we do to urban retail, which is our large cities and the retail distribution, the up and down the street accounts that we have, how do we get them to grow at a faster pace because these are the accounts which are also challenged by the emerging channels. so the first part on the left is about e-com and how do we do it. we have developed an in-house capability to have a model in place which will capture data-based consumer insights, which will then lead to personal content for consumers. and this is doing really well for us. this is a segment which is growing pretty well. and the second part is about the urban retail and rewriting our route-to-market. there are actually 5 parts to this. one is, how do we leverage high-potential outlets and service them in the way that we would want to. there are some outlets which require higher service frequency. there are some outlets which do not deserve the kind of frequency they get. so how do we right- size the service frequency for these outlets. second is, how do we upscale our salesmen capability so that they can deal with these outlets in page 3 of 16 britannia industries limited february 07, 2025 the right way. third is about upgrading our technology to provide the right productivity to the company. and fourth is to increase feet on street as the frequency levels require modification. so it's something that we've been working on. and it's in a pilot stage, but i can tell you that these are giving us good signs and good results. so we are looking at scaling this up in the quarter that we stand today. and we are also looking at refresh for our route-to-market for rural so that we can bring even a better way of servicing our rural customers. moving on to the next slide, which is about the sustained investments in brand. now what we focused on is critical growth brands and innovation. and what we've also done is we've done some higher-impact social media activations so that they can bring better productivity to our advertising efforts. and there are a lot of these products that we've launched, a lot of these promotions, i'm not going to, again, talk about each one of these, but these have given us really good connection with the consumers, especially our digital campaigns. we've also done some tactical consumer promotions. we -- there's one product, which is missing on these slides, which is the pure magic choco frames, which was launched towards the end of the last quarter, which is the quarter in question. this is a harry potter-themed product, very exciting product, which is a biscuit and a slab on it with the harry potter houses as different biscuits having different houses on it. and this is only for e-com and modern trade, but it's giving us really good results. now getting to the next slide, which is on some of our adjacency products as well. we've had some very exciting products. we've got a layer cake which is dual flavoured. we've launched rusk, which is a inr5 pack. we never had a inr5 pack in rusks. and there are a lot of the biscuit products which we've launched, which are doing quite well. our innovation pipeline is also catering to regional preferences and is helping us drive premiumness. for our adjacency business, again, some very exciting products. in croissant, we've launched a triple chocolate croissant. in -- we have a full cake relaunch coming up. we've started to roll it out. very exciting new graphics, very exciting recipes, products, which are beating competition by a mile. and hopefully, that's going to give us the right fillip for our entire cake portfolio. and similarly, cheese, we have a relaunch for our entire cheese portfolio, which is coming up. and we've started to roll that out as well with new graphics and new recipes, which are better than competition in every format. for our drinks, the season is upon us, and we are coming up with a very good campaign on winkin' cow. we've also got a very exciting product, which is the winkin' cow grow, which is a inr20 product, which is flavoured milk, which is fortified with 16 nutrients, which is basically vitamins and minerals, which support growth for children, also provide energy metabolism as well as strengthen the immune system. so that product has also been rolled out. page 4 of 16 britannia industries limited february 07, 2025 so it's going to be a very exciting season for us as far as drinks are concerned. our international business continues to perform well across, and we are hopeful that, that will continue. moving on to the next slide, which is on cost leadership. this is, again, an engine which is working really, really well. we've been presenting this to you forever, but let me just reinforce this one more time. the elements of our cost savings are on the left-hand side. so again, you can see what are the elements that we focus on. in 2013-'14, it used to be 0.7% of our revenue. and in this year, it's going to be 2.5% of our revenue. we've scaled it up deliberately, obviously, because of the inflationary trends that we are seeing. and we are hopeful that this will continue even as we get into the next year. the next slide is on esg. we've been recognized by times now for our esg impact. we've also been recognized by skoch esg awards for a silver on it. we've also had a campaign which has amplified our messages. it's been a campaign, which has been very well received. you can see it in the upper part of the slide. it's a campaign around trees, which is highlighting a milestone for britannia's esg journey around 100% plastic neutrality as well as energy efficiency and water stewardship. so we've -- there's a lot of news, which is being created because of this campaign. moving on to the next slide, which is on commodity inflation. as i was saying, for flour, there has been a 4% inflation, but this 4% would have been higher had we not had the forward buying that we've done on flour. palm has been a 43% inflation and that, too, despite our forward buying. so palm has been -- palm oil has been a very, very high inflation. sugar is flat. cocoa is at 103% inflation. laminates is nominal at 3% and corrugated boxes are at 15%. so our inflation for our products that we buy is about 11%. this would have been at least 2% to 4% higher had we not done the forward buying, and we hadn't had that advantage of that forward buying. moving on to the next slide. the -- on cost and profitability front, we've -- in the last 5 years, we've had inflation -- a total inflation of inr4,000 crores, right. and we've dealt with it in the right way. it was a one-way street for 2 years, and then it started to move up and down, and that's why we've had price decreases in the beginning of this year and now we've started to do price increases for the last 4, 5 months. we've dealt with this situation very well. and we are at a stage where we've taken all the necessary price increases which are going to get us to a stage where we counter the inflation. there are -- and if this inflationary trend continues, if we have to take slightly more price increases, that will be decided as we move into the next year, but we are very well prepared to be able to counter the inflationary trends. we are also doubling down on our cost efficiencies, as i said. we are planning to make sure, and as i keep repeating every time, these cost efficiencies and cost savings, they start with 0 on the 1st of april, and whatever has been achieved ends with the year, and there are new cost page 5 of 16 Britannia Industries Limited February 07, 2025 savings that come up every year. So we are again looking at 2.5% for next year, and hopefully even more than that. We have focused investments on innovations and on adjacencies. Some of the adjacencies have been doing very well. Croissant has been growing very high double digits. Our milk shakes have been growing double digits and similarly, wafers, etcetera. So we've been seeing traction as far as adjacency businesses are concerned, and we will continue to drive those. Our outlook, we are closely monitoring the commodity prices, as I said, and we are making sure that we are dynamic in the actions that we take. We are also vigilant to competitive pricing. We do not want to be completely out of whack, but it seems that the entire industry is facing a steep challenge, and it's all moving in the right direction. Our strategy will remain focused on driving our market share and also sustaining our profits, as we've done in the past. Now getting to the financials, revenue trends I've spoken about, so I'm not going to repeat that again, a 6% growth, operating profit up 3%. And finally, on the last slide, net sales up 6.5%, profit before tax up 3% and profit after tax up 4.5%. And if you were to look at the ratios, the numbers have moved up in the last 3 quarters, and we are at profit after tax of 13%. So with that, I will end my presentation and open the house for questions."

So this is based on the share price as at the end of last quarter and the current quarter. So last quarter end, the share price was INR6,338, that became about INR4,762 as of 31st of December, and that had an impact of about INR75 crores in the quarter."

                    "dialogue": "well, not so much. we've been -- yes, we did some forward buying, which helped us, as i said, to about 2% or 3%. but now with the season coming on wheat, march, the season starts. so hopefully, we will see some better prices as far as flour is concerned, and some normalization. so i think it should be okay. mihir shah: got it, sir. sir, and last clarification on the margin. so what is the margin range that you mentioned on the ebit level, 17%, did i get that correctly, sir? varun berry: which -- i didn't mention any margin range. which margin are you talking about? mihir shah: just to percy's question, you had mentioned -- i got confused between ebit and ebitda margin. if you can just reiterate what... varun berry: yes, yes, so he was talking about ebitda, i was talking about pat. mihir shah: you were talking about pat margins? n. venkataraman: profit from operations. varun berry: profit from operations. mihir shah: and what is the range, sir, you mentioned, sorry? varun berry: so we will stay in the current range, i would say. that would be the range that we would look at, although we don't give any forward-looking forecast, but i would say current range is what we would target. moderator: next question is from tejash shah from avendus spark. tejash shah: sir, yesterday, itc in its press release highlighted intense competition from local players in biscuits, but market continue to expand this quarter as well. so what are the key drivers that are working in our favour? varun berry: sorry, what -- i guess, our growths are coming through the strength of the brands as well as our distribution efforts. and we hope to continue with that. tejash shah: sure. sir, second, focus states are growing at 2, 2.5x versus the average for a while now. but at the aggregate level, we are not seeing the impact. it's not moving the needle yet. so what is current contribution where we have reached of this pocket of growth? and how -- at what point will you see that this number will actually start driving the overall growth? varun berry: see, the focus states are still very small in terms of our overall revenues. and we still are -- our market share in those focus states are half of what they are for the rest of the country. in fact, even less than half. so that's why the impact that you see is marginal at this point in time. as we keep -- now as i've said in the past as well, we don't want to do any big bang strategies in these page 10 of 16 Britannia Industries Limited February 07, 2025 states. The big bang strategies would be reduced price and try to get share from competition. We are not doing that. We are doing all the execution parameters, which is distribution, strengthening our brands, launching the new -- the right products for those markets and gaining share in a way that it becomes sustainable rather than unsustainable in the future. But as these states are growing, at some stage, they will start to add a lot more to the overall country level numbers as well."

                    "speaker": "Vipin Kataria",
                    "dialogue": "yes, so tejash, vipin this side. so these states basically contributes about 15-odd percent to our overall revenue. and they have been growing at about 1.3 to 1.4x, which means that over a period of time from 12%, 13%, they've moved to 15%, 16%. these states are like we keep saying these are opportunity states because that's where the biscuit consuming population is, and we have got a market share which is underleveraged, and therefore, there is a lot of headspace. and like varun said, i think the backbone that we want to build in these states is distribution- led, right, and brand-led. and that's the impetus that we've been able to put forward, which is giving us this kind of growth, right. so the other very important aspect of these states is that they are almost 35% contribution to the overall rural category. and if you see our growths in rural, they are pretty healthy because our focus states are really firing for us. so i think apart from the lever of contribution or salience, there are a lot of other impact areas that we see, and that's where we are working. moderator: next question is from latika chopra from jpmorgan. latika chopra: i wanted to get some more colour on non-biscuits portfolio, and how are you thinking about portfolio diversification over the next 2, 3 years? if you can give us some colour on how the salience of non-biscuits, it's growing at double digits, what kind of double digit? is it profitable? what is the distribution opportunity, which is still available? and also, how are you thinking about alternative stacking options? you had experimented with salty snacks in some markets. if you can throw some colour on how has been the reception? varun berry: yes. no, so first of all, the point is that if you look at our diversification, i think it's been pretty good. we have gotten into a lot more categories that we -- than we've ever been, right. so whether it's wafers or croissants or the cake formats that we've launched and all of the other products that we've launched have been pretty good. now we are in no hurry to get to 15 more categories because it doesn't make sense. i think it's important that we develop these categories and that's what we are seeing. so if you want to look at it, today, our croissant business is -- next year will cross inr200 crores, right. our milk shakes business has already crossed inr200 crores, right. so these are all numbers which have happened in the last 2 or 3 years, right, and growing pretty rapidly. now the point is that the base of biscuits is very large, and it doesn't really show a large change page 11 of 16 Britannia Industries Limited February 07, 2025 in that. But if this was to continue and if we were to double it up, I think we will be in a very good place to be able to showcase the portfolio that we've created. And some of the categories are genuinely premium and have entry barriers, which small competitors cannot cross, right. Now your question is on -- there will be products which will always be in experimental stage or pilot stage, and we will continue to make sure that we are diligent on those because, Latika, it doesn't make sense to do things in a bit of a rush because you will launch it and then you will create confusion, throw the cat amongst the pigeons and you will not be able to sustain the momentum from those categories. So salty snacks is one of those. We understand it's a very large category, but we also understand that it's a very competitive category. Till we are able to feel absolutely confident of being able to sustain our competitive edge with the large competitors that we have, we will not launch it nationally and that we are very clear about. And frankly, it's not that we just launch it and leave it in the pilot stage in some of the markets, we experiment. We look at different formats. We look at different ways to market. We look at advertising, pull, push, what will work, more grams in bag, trips to mouth, all of that. So all these experiments are showing us what works and what doesn't work. When we -- only when we are absolutely clear about it, we do not want to get into a large category like this without being absolutely clear of success. So that is really my message to you, Latika. But I can assure you that on some of the categories, we are seeing very good momentum, and we are hoping that all of our categories are going to be moving in that direction. Yes, Vipin."

                    "dialogue": "so latika, 2 more points. i think within biscuits, there are a lot of opportunities. so if you see cookies, which is one of the largest categories in biscuits, we have an immense opportunity in premiumization. and that are the kind of launches that we were talking about even in the deck. so let's say, we've launched fruit and nut, butter jeera within cookies, which is showing very good initial signs. and in each of these categories, there is enough opportunity, both on the differentiated and the premium end to keep adding more brands and sub-brands. there is another price point opportunity. so let's say, we talked about drinks where we are now coming up with a inr20 sku, which is a very large market and our participation was only in the inr35 or inr40. so i think while we will keep making sure that our adjacency business keeps accelerating, but i think within core, there are enough opportunities for us to keep moving the needle up. latika chopra: this is very detailed and clear. my second check was just on capex for fy '25, and are there any thoughts on capex for fy '26? varun berry: yes, we are going to take the capex break, so to say. we have put up plants and we will try and keep it as low as possible. it will still be -- what, venkat, about inr200 crores? n. venkataraman: for the next year? page 12 of 16 Britannia Industries Limited February 07, 2025"

                    "dialogue": "yes. n. venkataraman: should be even lower. varun berry: even lower. so inr150 crores to inr200 crores is what we'll keep it at, unless there is a volume increase. i don't think we need capex because we've got 3 new plants with new lines and capacity and head space and all of that. so i think we are in a good place as far as capex is concerned. moderator: next question is from aditya soman from clsa. aditya soman: just one question from me. i mean, on your sort of distribution revamp that you are doing, where are we on it? and in terms of the spends on that program, can you give us a sense whether there was an impact on profitability in the current quarter because of it? varun berry: see, the spends are going to be more related to how much we want to expand, right. so if we want to expand our 2 salesmen model to, let's say, another 100,000, 200,000 outlets, from 250,000, we want to go to 400,000, that will cost us a little bit of money, but it will pay us back a lot more than that, right. and just to remind you, we are talking about this in urban retail, right. and urban retail is the channel, which is the most profitable channel for us. that is 1.3x the profit of the company, the urban retail channel. so if that channel grows, it only gives us tailwinds as far as profit is concerned. moderator: next question is from amit sachdeva from ubs. amit sachdeva: just one small question. i may have missed something, but the employee cost, has there been some reorganization in the cost structure there? varun berry: no, there has not been any reorganization. it's just that last quarter, we had extra charge, which has got neutralized this quarter. so there's no reorganization. amit sachdeva: so what's the outlook for that? varun berry: we've always been very conscious of our overhead costs, but no, there's no reorganization. amit sachdeva: can you talk about the outlook for staff costs in the coming year as well? what should be the y- o-y kind of outlook? varun berry: so we focus on making sure that our top line growths, which i must confess that we've not been able to do in the last 2 years, but we -- our principle is that our -- if our top line growth is x, our fixed cost growth or our people cost growth should be 0.75x. and that's what we will keep with, so that we are leveraging our top line growths. amit sachdeva: got it. sorry, is it flexible enough that you can maneuver around that? or how does that work? varun berry: no, there is no flexibility. it's just the planning. you've got to plan for -- yes. page 13 of 16 Britannia Industries Limited February 07, 2025"

                    "dialogue": "sure. sure. got it, sir. sir, i just want to come back to you on the margin structure. if i understand correctly, the inflationary environment is going on and the gross margin was 38 and a bit, which is perhaps one of the places. do you expect the gross margin and the dynamic to give you 18% kind of -- if i could relate back to previous participant's question as well? are you sort of trying to keep margins in the range of 18% or -- ebitda margin i'm talking about? for the coming year, how the earnings dynamic that you see in terms of price increases, expected volume growth and your, obviously, expectation on cost. what i'm understand in that how -- in this context, how the earnings dynamic could actually play out in the next 3, 4 quarters? varun berry: see, we don't give any forward estimates. but as i had said, we are taking 6% to 6.5% price increase, which will be enough to get our absolute profit up to level. and then on top of that, we will look at other cost-saving measures, etcetera, to make sure that we keep to the margins that we've got. and we do not suffer any margin slip for our overall portfolio. but you got to remember that we've negotiated through this kind of environment many times, and we've done it quite well, and we will continue to do so even in the future. moderator: next question is from harit kapoor from investec. harit kapoor: so i just wanted to get your sense on the 6% volume growth. would the biscuits -- core biscuits business be in the similar range as this -- because your adjacencies have actually done quite well, so just wanted to get a sense on how biscuits run for -- india biscuits specifically for this quarter? varun berry: it's about 5.5%. so not a big difference. there's a delta, because as i said, the adjacency business is much smaller for us but growing faster. so the delta between the total volume growth and the biscuit volume growth is 0.8%, 0.9%. harit kapoor: and your analysis of how industry would have grown, your belief would that you would have done better? varun berry: yes, for sure. the exit numbers are certainly better. and even if you were to look at some of the public declarations on growths, etcetera, by some of the companies, it seems that we are ahead. obviously, nielsen gives us certain numbers, but they are based on taking a sample. when you look at the numbers declared by some of the public companies, it seems that we are certainly doing better than the others. harit kapoor: and my last question was on the pricing. i think the last time when we had this significant headwind on pricing on inflation was, i think, fiscal '23, if i'm not wrong, '22-'23, in that time, the price increase was extremely aggressive. this time, it seems like you're slightly more measured on that. is that really a function of market demand in your view, that you want to be a little bit more gradual as you put them in? varun berry: no, so we were measured because we were not clear where the inflationary trends are going from a deflation to inflation. and we were also hopeful -- actually not just us but the entire industry was hopeful that maybe the duties on fat, etcetera, will go away. but as our honorable finance minister has said, this is basically going to stay because they want to indigenize fats in page 14 of 16 Britannia Industries Limited February 07, 2025 India. So we are now clear that it's not going away. So now we are taking very decisive action on pricing."

            "dialogue": "not really because what happens is generally projects business comes at lower margins. and hence, you can say there was a pricing gap. otherwise, in the normal trade business there was no issue on the pricing front. but as i said, there are two factors, even the plant relocation led to some under absorption of manufacturing overheads that should also normalize in the coming quarters. so, switchgear we are quite confident that it remains under 38% to 40% contribution margin levels and it should come back to those levels. ravi swaminathan: understood. and with respect to lighting business, it has been -- i mean, there has been talks on the ground that the pricing should bottom out anytime soon or something of that sort, but still this quarter also i think there has been a bit of pricing decline which has been there. so, when do you expect this to turn around and what would have been the real volume growth that we would have seen in the lighting business? anil rai gupta: i think if we look at y-o-y, then there is a price erosion, but as we are now seeing that there is a bottoming out of the price erosion. but the volume growth has been healthy. it's around 13%- 14% in lighting. so, we are generally positive about the lighting growth and overall, with the price erosion coming or tapering should also start showing back in profitability levels. ravi swaminathan: okay. and overall general demand wise say in the month of december, january so far, how it has been, are we seeing a bit of weakness or is it started to recover any sense on that? anil rai gupta: mixed feelings about that because as we see a large part of the business also saw some destocking - which is wires. overall, consumer trend was started off a bit slow, but it started gaining a little bit traction towards the end of the quarter. so i would say it's early days to comment, but there was some sort of a positive sentiment in the consumer demand. ravi swaminathan: understood sir. thanks a lot. moderator: thank you. the next question is from the line of natasha jain from phillipcapital. please go ahead. natasha jain: thank you for the opportunity. so, my first question is on the ac side. now third quarter, i understand is a lean quarter for cooling products such trend, but on the appliances side especially water heaters, room heaters and even kitchen appliances, they have done well on the ground. so, i'm just trying to understand how that performed for you and what is the reason for such a sharp decline because some benefits should have flown in from your appliances category. so that's my first question, sir? anil rai gupta: yes. i think for us we saw a very strong quarter in domestic appliances business. we also saw a stronger quarter in water heaters, though not a very high growth because it is coming after a couple of years of flattish growth in water heater business, but we saw a very positive quarter for water heaters also. page 3 of 16 Havells India Limited January 17, 2025 There is some amount of, I would say, restabilization and repositioning of our appliances business which is also leading to this growth. But overall if we compare the appliances business, the contribution margins are lower as compared to products like fans and water heaters. And hence, there a sharp growth here (appliances), we saw a little bit of a dip in the overall contribution side. But I think there's a lot of work going on towards that. The other businesses like fans, water heaters, they are all still going strong on the margin front. So, we are confident that overall ECD should come back to normal levels of margins in this quarter and next quarters."

            "dialogue": "understood, sir. and sir, second question a follow-up on the lighting side. now i understand that because of the driver on board, there was asp compression, but a new trend i picked up on the channel it is also a compression that has started on chip-onboard technology. now i understand this is primarily used for premium lighting and because havells is a premium player, does this impact you or has it impacted you in the third quarter? rajiv goel: no, i think look the deflationary trend you see in the pricing is across the board. so, you are right the cob also has not been sort of spared on that side. so yes, i think that's why while we focus more on premium and the emerging technologies, you should appreciate that when there is a deflationary trend in the led chips, i think it will have impact. now the impact extent could vary. you see on the commoditized business it will be far severe than it will be on, let's say, the innovative product, but the effect definitely will be there. so, i think that pricing trend pressure we have seen across the board including cob. natasha jain: got it. and sir, if i may, just one last question. in terms of copper prices now we've seen a flattish trend, but january onwards, it started to pick up slightly. so given that the channel has destocked heavily in the third quarter, can we expect a rise in wires in the 4q plus cables being a seasonal quarter for 4q, should we see like a good momentum in this category in the upcoming quarters? anil rai gupta: yes, you are right on both fronts. we will see restocking happening in domestic wire business. also, rising copper also helps, but that is a bit of overstocking that does not necessarily mean that the consumer demand goes up, but that is a very temporary phenomenon. and you're right, the fourth quarter is generally high for underground cables as well. natasha jain: got it. thank you so much sir and all the best. moderator: thank you. the next question is from the line of rahul agarwal from ikigai asset management. please go ahead. rahul agarwal: hi, sir. good morning. thank you for the opportunity. sir, just one clarification on the earlier question. on switchgear, just wanted to understand the need for relocation of the plant and what was the relocation cost booked for the quarter? page 4 of 16 Havells India Limited January 17, 2025"

            "dialogue": "so i would not be able to give you the costs on this call, but the need for relocation is strategic reasons. we want to combine certain manufacturing activities and that's a constant strategic evaluation which keeps happening between manufacturing facilities. rahul agarwal: so, it's gone from where to where, the shift has happened from which location to which location? anil rai gupta: so, we had a small very old plant in faridabad which has now moved to sahibabad which was also our industrial switchgear facility. so, two facilities are now combined into one. rahul agarwal: got it, sir. so should i attribute the entire 3%-4% lower contribution margin to entirely relocation or is there anything else you said industrial... anil rai gupta: as i said, i think there was also a product mix issue or a channel mix issue between trade and projects business. so that is also contributing partly to this decline in contribution margin. rahul agarwal: got it, anil ji. and lastly on the \u201cother\u201d segment like post-covid, i think this is the first time you reported ebit loss, additional investment could you elaborate what is the thought process and when will it normalize? rajiv goel: the additional investment in these emerging categories is on the new channels where we are investing to grow these businesses further. and you have seen a good growth in this segment which we want to continue to sustain. and sometimes, what happens that it just gets captured in a quarter. so i mean these things we believe will get normalized in next quarter. rahul agarwal: okay. so incremental investments will continue, but it should not result into any cash burn is what you're saying, right? rajiv goel: yes, that's right. rahul agarwal: perfect sir. thank you so much. i will get back in the queue. moderator: thank you. the next question is from the line of sonali salgaonkar from jefferies india. please go ahead. sonali salgaonkar: sir thank you for the opportunity and wish the entire team a great 2025. sir, my first question, sorry for checking on this again on the switchgear margins. and i would like to check if i look at the ebit segmental margin of switchgears, it used to be about 28% about a year back and we have now come to about 18%. so i understand the interim reason of the plant relocation in this quarter, but is there anything structural in your view which is plaguing this segment as in product mix or higher competition or do we think it is transitory and we might get back at those 28% margins, ebit? anil rai gupta: the margins varies between the quarters, which are the quarters where we are investing in brand building for a certain product category. but i think overall we should be around 24%-25% in switchgears. 28% is also abnormal and 18% is also abnormal. i think 24%-25% is a decent number to expect. page 5 of 16 Havells India Limited January 17, 2025"

            "dialogue": "got it, sir. sir, my second question would be any thoughts on the impending summer season because much of our product portfolio is also summer-centric. how are the channels reacting to that? i mean, i know it's a bit too early, but are we expecting a good summer and is there any restocking ahead of that already? anil rai gupta: i think generally once you come after a good summer season there is a positivity in the channel, but that does not necessarily mean that it will translate into a high consumption in this year because weather is something which nobody can predict. but the general positivity is there in terms of the channel. stocking starts happening in january-february in case of air conditioners and around end february-march for fan season. so, it's a bit early to say. let's see, but the channel is generally positive because last year when we were entering the season it was not with a very high positive intent, but this season should be seeing some positive intent. sonali salgaonkar: so that's very helpful. sir, my next question would be related to the pricing actions. any categories wherein you have contemplated or taken any pricing actions be it either positive or negative during this quarter? anil rai gupta: well, usually there are pricing actions in lighting because of the deflation in led. in switchgears and fans, raw materials have been generally stable over a medium term, so there's not major pricing actions. some things keep happening, but with the fluctuation in copper and aluminum, cables and wires prices keep getting adjusted up and down. sonali salgaonkar: understood and because of the rupee depreciation impact, would you think because the import compressors there could be some pricing action upward in the air conditioner segment? anil rai gupta: that is true. sonali salgaonkar: any quantum, single digits? anil rai gupta: we still have to see that. but again, as i said, these are minor variations which keep happening in the market through schemes or pricing actions. sonali salgaonkar: understood. sir, my last question, any particular reason for the strong contribution margin in the lighting segment this quarter? anil rai gupta: again, this is generally a stronger quarter for lighting because of the diwali season and some schemes ending. i think 30%-32% is the normalized contribution margin level for lighting. and as against the industry we've been premiumization and as a result we've been able to maintain that level. again, let's not compare quarter-on-quarter each quarter, but overall, 30%- 32% is a decent expectation. sonali salgaonkar: got it. sorry, sir, i missed one point. the cables and wires channels, we saw destocking in q3. have the channels destocked again? is the inventory normal right now? anil rai gupta: in wires particularly, we saw destocking in q3. it's coming back to normalized levels, yes. page 6 of 16 Havells India Limited January 17, 2025"

            "dialogue": "got it. and lastly if you see end november, december in general consumer demand saw significant deterioration and weakness, especially on the b2c side. so how was it at your end? and does it concern you that now it's been a couple of years that consumer demand really hasn't come out well and there have been concerns on this on a broader side. so, if you can share some of your views and insights on this? anil rai gupta: yes. i think when we started out this financial year, we were more positive. the first 6 months saw improvement in the consumer demand, but again around diwali season we started seeing some weakness. i also feel that during the end of the quarter, starting of the fourth quarter, we see some improvement. underlying to all this, the overall industrial infra demand continues to remain positive. so havells is a mix of many things with our industrial infra business, with our focus on channel expansion, our focus on product market share expansion. so while the consumer sentiment may remain a bit weak, we will continue to do our actions and hopefully achieve growth better in the market. renu: sure. got it sir. thanks much and best wishes. thank you. moderator: thank you. the next question is from the line of kunal sheth from b&k securities. please go ahead. kunal sheth: hi, sir. thank you for the opportunity. so, i just needed one clarification. in media interaction today, we did mention ex-lloyd margin of 12% to 13%. so that was you're referring to the ebit margin or the ebitda margin for ex-lloyd business? rajiv goel: segment margins. kunal sheth: so that's ebitda margin, right, ex-lloyd? rajiv goel: no, that is -- yes, ebitda, but there are unallocated has to be taken out of that. so i think when you look at our analysis, which we give the segment results. so, this is based on that. kunal sheth: okay. and what is the timeframe we are looking to achieve this? anil rai gupta: well, i think it should come back to normal levels in the coming year. kunal sheth: fy '26? anil rai gupta: yes. kunal sheth: okay. sure. that was it. thank you so much. page 8 of 16 Havells India Limited January 17, 2025"

Also, MFI channel is also going through a lot of issues. So how do we handle that? And then second question is on the CSD. We have heard that there are a lot of inventory correction happening in the CSD channels also. So that is also in a way hurting the primary sales, while secondary sales continue to remain high.

                    "dialogue": "hello. thank you for the opportunity. so, my question is on the broader line, especially on the - - your b2c side of the business where we are seeing some impact on the margin because of the product mix changes. so can we correlate this to the whole consumer industry where the rural demand is higher than the urban demand or if we can get just a hint of what the mix in terms of urban and rural in the b2c business? rajiv goel: look, rural is still not a large part of our business unlike fmcg. so, it will be difficult to say. but yes, rural demand has held well. but we will not attribute, you see what you call the weakening of margins to that. i think there have been multiple reasons for the same. and you see the way we are seeing the strengthening in the consumer demand, hopefully which will sustain, i think it will help us to have a better product mix and the margins as well. but i don't think, at least in our case, i am sure for our industry, the rural or urban segregation plays such a significant role. chaitanya: all right. so, in general can we say that from the margin point of view, at least from the b2c point of view, we can see improvement from here on, at least from the early indication that you mentioned that positive demand is there? rajiv goel: that's right. chaitanya: okay. correct. thank you very much. moderator: thank you. ladies and gentlemen, in the interest of time, this will be our last question. it's from the line of nirransh jain from bnp paribas. please go ahead. nirransh jain: hi, sir. thank you for the opportunity. sir, first question on the ecd side. so just wanted to better understand like you mentioned that the contribution margin decline was because of the product mix shift towards the sda. but isn't there a seasonality angle to it like with mostly the third quarter having a higher mix towards the sda versus like fans. so, what exactly led to this product mix shift in this quarter? that is my first question? rajiv goel: i think the growth in sda was far higher. because you are doing comparison with the last year basically. so, growth in sda was far higher than the growth in the other categories. yes, seasonality-wise, it is favoring the sda, but the extent of that favor or the growth or the proportion is much higher than the portfolio of ecd in this quarter vis-a-vis the last quarter. that is the reason. nirransh jain: sure, sir. and sir, secondly, on the switchgear side, again, i'm sorry, coming back to the same question. i can understand this quarter specific reasons with plant relocation and product mix shift, but we are seeing consistent margin decline for the last three quarters. i'm talking about the contribution margins y-o-y decline. so do we see this product mix shift towards project business is just a transient in nature and there is nothing structural with the shift happening more towards project versus the modular switches because of rising competition? page 15 of 16 Havells India Limited January 17, 2025"

Talking about Oil and Gas business, natural decline in our fields has been partially offset by infill wells brought online in Mangala, Aishwarya, and Raageshwari Deep Gas Fields, We drilled nine infill wells across the Mangala and Aishwarya fields in Quarter 3 FY '25, thereby taking the total count of infill wells to 18 in the initial nine months of FY '25. Our EBITDA performance improved 2.5% sequentially, supported by improvement in price realization despite some slackness in volume. To unlock the potential of our East Coast deepwater block, we have recently awarded contracts for controlled source electromagnetic review. This advanced technology shall help us de-risk the prospect and prioritize the drilling sequence. We expect to complete this activity by May 2025. Our Iron Ore business has been a strong increase in quarterly production, rising 10% year-on- year and 17% sequentially, primarily driven by the Bicholim Mine in Goa. Despite the geotechnical and operational issues encountered at the Bicholim Mine, we have now achieved the production run rate of 2.4 million tons per annum for saleable ore. Looking forward with the pig iron business receiving environmental clearance for 1.2 million tons per annum capacity, we are geared up for improved realization and profitability in the business. Now, let me provide an update on our key growth projects. First on aluminum business. I am delighted to announce that we have successfully doubled our rolled Rolled Product capacity at BALCO to 100 KTPA. With this commissioning, Vedanta has become the second largest producer of rolled products by capacity in India. There has also been an addition of 30,000 tons per annum, aluminum silica Ingots and 50,000 per annum Slab capacity. Moving on to the Lanjigarh Refinery, the ramp-up of Train 1 is now progressing steadily. Despite some teething issues and challenges on the supporting infrastructure side, we are making gradual progress. Train 2 is scheduled for commissioning in quarter 4 of current fiscal year. In addition, the BALCO smelter expansion is now in an advanced stage with commissioning targeted in Quarter 1 of FY '26. In Zinc India, the 160,000 tons per annum roaster at Debari and 510,000 tons per annum fertilizer plant are progressing as planned with final commissioning targeted for quarter 4 of the current fiscal and quarter 4 of the next fiscal respectively.

This marks four consecutive quarters of improvement, demonstrating our commitment to reducing leverage and progressing towards our target of bringing this ratio below 1x. Free-cash flows, pre-CAPEX generation stood at 6,766 crores in Q3, up 57% Y-o-Y, further strengthening our liquidity position. As a result, our cash and cash equivalents stood at Rs. 21,138 crores as on December 2024. Moving now to VRL and the bonds. A key highlight is the significant progress we have made in deleveraging our parent company, Vedanta Resources, VRL. Over the last 2.5 years, we have reduced the debt of VRL by 4.3 billion, bringing it down to 4.8 billion, the lowest level in a decade. In the first nine months of the current fiscal year alone, the VRL's debt has been declined by 1 billion. Further, in the last four months, we have restructured VRL's entire 3.1 billion bond portfolio, securing longer maturities of up to eight years, more favorable covenant terms, and a significant reduction in our debt cost by 250 basis points. This momentum will continue as we drive further deleveraging, optimizing capital structure, and secure more favorable financing terms for both VDL and VRL. An update on our ratings. Our strong business performance and improved liquidity have translated into significant rating upgrades. Both CRISIL and ICRA has augmented Vedanta's rating to Double A, while VRL has seen an impressive 6 notch improvement over the last 12 months reaching a B plus rating. These upgrades reaffirm the strength of our financial position both on the P&L and balance sheet and underscores the confidence the market places in our strategic direction. On the demerger front, we are in the important stage of execution, the shareholders and the creditors meeting scheduled on Feb 18th. This transformative step is poised to unlock significant value for our investors."

                    "dialogue": "thanks, hitesh. very elaborate answer. so, what it means is that in h2 fy '26 maybe we can see the production bumping up if all these initiatives and steps go in the right direction. will it be a reasonable assumption? hitesh vaid: the way i will interpret is that for h2, we will see the benefit, the larger chunk benefit from the asp injection which we have already invested money and are doing a small injection as well as of now. but from now to the next six months, we are doing a lot of infill wells for which the approval was there and those wells are also starting to come online. so, we will start seeing incremental volumes from them which will arrest our decline and have a stable volume going forward. amit dixit: okay, got it. the second question is on zinc international. now, massive improvement in cost, something that we have not seen in zinc india as well. but of course, the scope to improve and to scale much more in international. so, i just wanted to understand how much of this decline is sustainable because it is much beyond your own guidance. so, what are the key drivers behind it? and how much of it is sustainable going forward? ajay goel: requesting chris to address this, and also in case, chris, you want to give the bigger picture for overall base metal and kcm. chris griffith: okay, ajay, thanks. thanks for the question. i think we had a really spectacular 3rd quarter in terms of costs. i think that's probably a little bit better than we are expecting to do. and my expectation is that we should see the cost range between $1,200 and $1,300. so, that's massively down from the $1,600, $1,700 a ton that we were seeing earlier on in the year. so, this is perhaps a little bit better than we would expect going forward, but what we have been seeing is a sustainable increase in the volume from zi. so, we are going through a particular weak patch last year and this year. as we needed to increase the amount of stripping, we had some geotechnical challenges. we needed to push back the one wall of the one pit. we had very, very constrained areas in the remaining pit, in the second pit that we were going through, old underground workings. so, all those challenges, i think we have largely worked themselves through. we have increased the stripping, just to give you an example, from the beginning of this financial year, we were stripping at about 4.5 million tons per month. we have just hit two months in a row at 8 million tons a month. so, that's the rate that we require for both of the phase-1 and phase-2. so, i think we are finally starting to get ourselves into a much more sustainable position. this next year that we see, so we will definitely see another uptick again in the 4th quarter. and then in the year of '26, we are going to see another much more sustainable performance from zi. page 9 of 21 sensitivity: internal (c3) Vedanta Limited January 31, 2025 So, what you should see is overall lower cost than we have been seen, but perhaps not quite as good as the 1,100. And as I said, I think the range should be in about 1,200 to 1,300. And then as Arun said in the introductory session, what we will see is that the end of this financial year, so at the very end of '25, we will see the completion of Phase-2, and then in the first quarter of next year, so the end of the Financial Year \u201826, we will have ramped up the production. So, the 2027, then we see production from both Phase-1 and Phase-2. So, overall, we are expecting to see continued improvement and much better results from ZI going forward. And then Ajay, just to check while I am speaking, would you like me just to talk a little bit about KCM here?"

Because we stopped one of the two pits, we only had the one pit. We are delivering volume out of one of the two pits. So, we are getting ourselves into a much more sustainable position. We also were mining through historical underground workings. So, the one pit of the two that we had was work going through underground holes that made it very difficult to have open-pit mining. Now, I mentioned that we have made substantial progress with mine through those underground workings. We still only have one pit available. And during the course of '26, we get ourselves into a position where we start getting two pits producing. So, now I think '26 will still be a fairly challenging year for us, but we should see a substantial increase in the production from ZI. So, we should do somewhere between 160 and 180 kilotons of production this year. And next year, this is not our guidance. We will give official guidance at the end of the year, but we will see somewhere between sort of 240, 250 kilo tons of production from Gamsberg and Black Mountain next year. So, a very substantial pickup in production, over 20, 25% next year. But what we won't see is any of the production because we only finished the Phase-2 plant at the end of the Financial Year \u201826. So, you will see both Phase-1 and Phase-2 delivering in 2027. So, next year, to summaries all of that, much better production. We have worked ourselves through most of the problems. We had the run rate of stripping, I mentioned, 8.5 million tons per month is double what we were started at the beginning of the year, 4.5. So again, we are stripping at the rate now that we need for both plants. So, we have got a little bit of catch up to do, and we will see that catching up during the course of 2026. So, I would say that 2026, most of the problems are worked through, but we are still going to be, I think, fairly tight. And under those circumstances, if anything goes wrong, then it does impact you. But we are going to be in a much better position next year, and then from 2027 onwards, you are going to see ZI in a fantastic position and then it will be generating cash flow that I think you will be proud of. Thanks."

Now the Board has decided and recommended to extend this ICL by almost 15 months. So, out of 400, the loan now becomes due in over 2 tranches. So, 200 million is due in January 26th. So, it is one year from now. Another 200 million is due in May 26. So, it has been extended by on an average 15 months. Now, if I look at the current debt stack at Vedanta Resources, $4.8 billion, one can think of three cohorts, roughly 3, 3.1 billion is multiple bonds. And that is what we have restructured over the last three, four months. Another billion is multiple bank loans, which are mostly from the Indian state PFC bankers. And the remainder billion is basically the PCF from Stan Chart. So, 3 billion bonds, a billion bank loans and a billion PCF."

And I am very hopeful that Quarter 1 off, as per the original guideline, original target of Ghogarpalli, quarter 4 of FY '26, they are going to take out the first coal for the Ghogarpalli."

Overall, while incremental stress formation is showing early signs of stability, we continue to be cautious on the microfinance segment. We are also watchful of implications from the new MFIN guidelines once they get implemented. Nevertheless, we continue to believe in our approach of addressing focusing on 1) funding requirements of vintage customers and centres, 2) being conservative on overall customer industry indebtedness, 3) investing in collection infrastructure and 4) continued diversification of the loan book. 3."

The pre provision operating profit margins remains healthy to absorb incremental stress in microfinance. Asset quality outside microfinance has been robust including in vehicle finance segment. 5. The capital adequacy levels are healthy even after considering current microfinance stress, evolving regulatory requirements and the Bank\u2019s growth ambitions. With this we can open for Q&A."

                    "dialogue": "got it, sir. and i have 1 more question, if i may squeeze in. it's on deposits. so is there any further debulking of deposits likely in the coming quarters? or now the overall deposit growth should kind of move in line with the retail deposit growth? sumant kathpalia: so i believe that we will continue to reduce our bulk deposits. i've said that before. and we have shared our expectations to the market of having 48% to 50% share of retail lcr deposits and loan deposit ratio of around 88% to 90%. so that's the only guidance we can give you and we will continue to do what is necessary to granularize the liability. moderator: next question is from the line of chintan joshi from autonomous. chintan joshi: just follow up on that nim point from earlier. i appreciate you don't want to guide us on what might happen in the near term. but how should i think about kind of nim evolution, say, 12, 18 months down the line once we are past this mfi stress period. how big is mfi now going to be part of the loan book? and also what kind of margin should we expect once that kind of stabilizes at the level that you want now that we kind of appreciate more that mfi will remain cyclical. i wonder if you're thinking it may go back to 12% of the loan book down the line or not. and related to that, i would like to understand through the cycle, how do you see the roa on the mfi business? we go through external shocks in this book every few years. so just trying to understand how you think about through-the-cycle roas in this business? sumant kathpalia: so there are multiple questions which you've asked. so let me try to address all your questions. the number one question is on what would be the share of mfi in your loan book. you've seen that over the past 3 years, we've been continuously reducing the share of the mfi. it was close to 13-14%, which is now gradually reduced to 9%. we want to keep it around to 8% to 10%. i think that is the optimal size of the mfi book. that's our first step. we are also diversifying our overall rural business. we continue to believe that rural is a great opportunity in the country, and we continue to diversify this book. we are also launching a segment called bharat vikas banking, which will house our rural focused businesses including merchant acquiring business, other bharat financial businesses and some other rural products such as small sme loans will also start getting launched in this vertical. we are diversifying this business from micro finance into bharat vikas banking so that we don't compromise on the growth of this segment. while it\u2019s given that the mfi business is cyclical in nature, we continue to believe that across cycles, mfi business should give you 2.5% to 3% roa. in some years, it can give you 4%, in some years it can give you 1.5% also. so i'm saying 2.5% to 3% roa across the cycle in this business. and if you look at this business on a holistic basis, i think it's an efficient business if done well. you need to keep buffer provisions in this business. i believe if you continue to keep 2% of the book as buffer provisions, you should be able to manage the stress. i've always said this book will run at a credit cost of towards 2.5% to 3.5%. you keep a 2% buffer provisions and in a cyclical trend, it should be able to take care by plus/minus 1%. that's how you should manage this business. i hope i have been able to answer your questions. chintan joshi: yes. and then i have one on deposits. when i think about kind of your stable deposits within your retail deposits, it's about 5% of the total lcr retail deposits. why is that page 9 of 16 IndusInd Bank Limited January 31, 2025 number that low? If I think about your branch franchise in number of Tier 2, Tier 3 cities, Tier 4 cities, that granularity should be higher, but how that stable deposit number is a little low. I'm just wondering how that can be improved."

                    "dialogue": "chintan, there are different ways in which some of these guidelines are interpreted. you would notice that some banks have very low number, some banks have slightly higher numbers. i'll take you through granularity offline through a separate discussion. moderator: next question is from piran engineer from clsa india. piran engineer: congrats on the quarter in this challenging environment. just circling back to micro finance. firstly, is january better than december, if you can comment obviously, on collections, not growth? sumant kathpalia: if you look at the forward flows, it looks better in the 0-dpd bucket. but if you look at what has flown into the 30-plus bucket, what had accrued in october and november, we are seeing that some npa flows are happening from that bucket as of now. piran engineer: okay. understood. so stage 2 flowing into stage 3. sumant kathpalia: yes. so what is encouraging is the forward flows in 0-dpd bucket have stabilized, and it has improved. piran engineer: fair enough. and given that the new guidelines in mfi will be out in april, have we proactively stopped this 2 plus 1, i mean, have you moved to 2 plus 1? or are we still okay being the fourth lender if a proposal comes right now? sumant kathpalia: so if you look at the data which we have given in presentation, 86% of our business is bfil plus 2. and we want to get that to 95% to 98%. piran engineer: no, no. i get that. eventually, it has to be 100%. my question is, right now, if you're getting a proposal where you're the fourth lender, okay, let's say, today on 31st jan, will you take it up? or will you say no anyway in 2 months, you can't do it. so why do it now? that's my question. j sridharan: yes. we already have got put in our system that any new customers, we will not have bfil plus 2. and for an existing customer, maximum, we'll allow 1 more lender. and when the mfin guidelines come, the latest rule we need to change that for a new or existing relationship, it will be bfil plus 2. in terms of business impact, i think it will not be significant. we will manage, but for quite some time, we have been having the higher number of lenders who were built into the system. piran engineer: got it. and sir, since you're on the call, how should we think about mfi industry growth once all this is settled, say, 2 quarters later? because clearly, i think the industry is maxed out on the number of the tam in terms of number of borrowers and then should we just think of it as a ticket size, which is similar to inflation. so the mfi industry grows at 6%, 7%? or how do we think about industry growth here? j sridharan: i believe the industry is likely to grow 15%-16% with new geographies getting added. still there are pockets in the country where lending is not taking place, whether we will participate in that and how the industry will move there is what we need to see. if you see the growth post the rbi unification of the guideline that growth has been quite significant, and there is also only a 10% degrowth from the highs. so the overall picture, whether mfi industry will continue to grow at 25%, i don't believe so. 10% to 15% growth in the jlg model is likely to be there, but that also will come more from newer geographies and less from new customers in the existing geographies. page 10 of 16 IndusInd Bank Limited January 31, 2025"

                    "dialogue": "i have two questions, one for mr. j sridharan to clarify and one to mr. sriram. on mfi, for the bfil plus 3 customers, existing customers, are you giving repeat loans for the moment? or are they also not getting repeat loans? and in the quarter, out of the inr1,700-odd crores provisions, how much provision have you made for mfi? is it around inr550 crores, give or take? back to the question on vehicles. j sridharan: as far as the number of lenders are concerned, as of now, we give loans only on a very selective customers. so an existing customer having three other lenders, if there is an ability, because if you know our overall limit is the lowest in the industry. we still do not lend more than 1.25 lakh net industry exposure. so we are very selective in lending and the proportion of loans going to good customers in that segment also is low. once the mfi regulations come, obviously, we will not be lending to that customer. the entire industry will move to lender plus 2 norm. abhishek murarka: okay. but as of now, they are getting, if they're a good customer, they are getting a repeat loan. j sridharan: they are because that is part of the program. we have not stopped, but that's a very small number, not a substantial or significant number. indrajit yadav: in terms of provisioning, we don't share business-wise provisions. so we have given you slippages. different businesses have their own provision coverage ratios, which we try to maintain. bank as a whole, you would have seen, we have maintained 70% pcr. business unit level net npa as well as provisions we don't share. abhishek murarka: okay. no worries. and on vehicles, 4q is generally quite strong for disbursement as well as for recovery, etcetera. so asset quality. do you see that kind of trend or this inr13,000-odd crores of disbursement in the quarter, that was just a bit of an aberration? and the segment is still going through a bit of consolidation. so it will come down. so just some commentary on growth and asset quality in the next maybe 3 to 6 months there would help. a. g. sriram: q3 was good. the growth rate of vehicles, if you see the retail growth rate has been in single digits, except for 2-wheelers. so not much is expected to change in the q4 also, it should be in the similar lines. and commercial vehicle is expected to grow in sync with the gdp. unless gdp grows over 6%, there may not be much of growth in commercial vehicle segment. gone are those days when sales in commercial vehicle was the trendsetter. now more or less people like to buy with the work order only. so as and when gdp increases, there will be growth in commercial vehicle sector. so more or less, we are expecting for a similar disbursements numbers in q3 around rs.13,500 crores. abhishek murarka: and asset quality there? a. g. sriram: again, q4 is one of the best quarters. so we are keeping our fingers crossed. abhishek murarka: done. a very quick question on mfi how is the disbursement trending? like given that forward flows have improved the data that you shared, is disbursement going to pick up? and versus q3, is it going to be higher? or maybe jan, what's the run rate, some indication there would help. sumant kathpalia: we want to be cautious about the disbursements. we continue to remain a watchful of the trends. i think what is more important is to focus on your good customers and good centers and that is where 85% to 88% of our disbursement should be targeted. that's our philosophy. we are not looking at any disbursement number. what is important is to make sure that we service our customers well. and we are in the in centers which are performing well and do the disbursements there. page 12 of 16 IndusInd Bank Limited January 31, 2025"

                    "dialogue": "right. but sumant, just qoq, it should improve, right, given that there is an improvement in the 0 dpd bucket, etcetera? sumant kathpalia: yes, it should, but i don't want to give any number as of now. because i want to continue to watch this space, how the karnataka develops, how does it pass on to another state, how does up behave? so i don't want to give any numbers or projection of the mfi business as of now. moderator: next question is from the line of jai mundhra from icici securities. jai mundhra: sir, just a few questions. first, on mfi or bfil, do we also cross-sell any 2-wheeler or personal loan or a small cv to these customers? and if yes, what would be the exposure? sumant kathpalia: we don't do any personal loans on this segment. it's already an unsecured segment. so we don't want to increase unsecured exposure in this segment any further. we did try scooter loans. we did about 2,000 scooter loans. we did it as a pilot and stopped it as the delinquencies were high. jai mundhra: right. so there is no other exposure, right? i mean there is no other retail products or any other? sumant kathpalia: we don't believe that we can do any other cross-sell into the except liabilities, which we talked about rs.2,600 crores of deposits. jai mundhra: right. sure. secondly, sir, if you can also highlight the net npa in mfi, right, that will help give us some direction in terms of the additional provisioning needed. you have a gross npa of inr2,400 crores. and if you can sort of quantify what is the pcr here? or what is the net npa here? sumant kathpalia: our pcr overall is 70%, like indrajit said, we don't give product specific net npa or provisions. so i think that is not something we give it in public domain, but i can tell you that we are well provided and well covered. jai mundhra: sure. and lastly, sumant, if i look at the contingent provisions that we have right now, that is roughly around 4% of the mfi loans. and you have said that sma 1 plus 2 is around 4%. so are we sort of done in terms of whatever additional slippages that come through in fourth quarter, you will be providing those, or we may continue to carry this contingent provisions going ahead in fy '26. is that the way to think about this? or there would be some change in this contingent stock? sumant kathpalia: it's too early to comment on whether we will use contingent provisions or not. i've always said the bank should be adequately covered and we will always be conservative on provisions and to make sure that we have enough coverage to take care of any eventuality especially in the highly volatile businesses, like micro finance. we also want to be prepared for the ecl when it comes in. so, given these 2 scenarios, we continue to believe that the bank should carry enough contingent provisions as we move forward. whether we will use anything, it's way too early. we will see how the flows happen in the mfi, how the business goes and then we will take a call. jai mundhra: sure, sir. and lastly, sir, i think there was an exit of cfo. and of course, we have already disclosed that. if you can comment on any other attrition that you are seeing at the senior level? or if you want to sort of comment on that thing? page 13 of 16 IndusInd Bank Limited January 31, 2025"

                    "dialogue": "so we have a very stable management team. if you look at it, over the period, a lot of earlier people have gone and new people have come in, whether it's the cto, cro, cco or internal audit head. we've got a lot of new people. so we've always said that a good mix of management will always have a good understanding of the business, and we get a new perspective on the business from lateral hires. having said that, the hr head is here, and maybe he can comment on it. zubin mody: thanks, sumant. we had a very stable leadership right from 2008 to 2020. simply because of the age of the people at a particular point of time, people retired at the same time, and we added a lot of new people. so there is a good blend of old and the new, with more new now. and again, this year, i guess, we'll have a couple of people retiring together. so we are already in the process of identifying people. we will not be having any position unfilled for any length of time. and so our backfill hiring for these positions continue and we will be sorted on our top management talent at all times. moderator: your next question is from the line of shubhranshu mishra from phillipcapital. shubhranshu mishra: the first one is on credit cards, the gross npa has inched up on a sequential basis. and just wanted to understand the architecture of our enr share, what percentage is transactors, how much is revolvers and how much are the emi proportion? if you can speak about the number of credit card customers who have 2 or more credit cards? 3 plus credit cards and 4 plus credit cards. that's on the credit card. the second one is on vehicle financing, especially the scv, lcv, hcv, there's been commentary around asset quality rip off and slowdown here. so how do we see this market and what has been our experience? and what do we think of the growth levels in these 3 specific segments going forward in the next year including small commercial vehicle, light commercial vehicle and medium and heavy commercial vehicle? a. g. sriram: commercial vehicle is behaving well, the portfolio has been improving, and i believe it will continue to improve. light commercial vehicle, as people have given more loans towards the new to credit, there will be some increased slippages, but it will be compensated by the higher rate of interest. small commercial vehicle, again, the same way like nearly 50%-60% are new to credit wherein quite a bit of default occurs. but loss given default (lgd) is somewhere around 45%. the yields in small commercial vehicle is higher than light commercial vehicle and heavy commercial vehicle. so overall, roa of the product is good and it gives you a good customer base. shubhranshu mishra: and the credit card question. sumant kathpalia: yes. so you know that our unsecured business, including personal loan is a very small portion. it's only 6% of our book. we've always said that because we have micro finance, we will keep it around 6%. of this, 3% is credit card and 2.5% is personal loans on that segment. our credit card gnpa are elevated because you know the industry issues which are coming in. and the gross flows are elevated as of now. and if you look at the other retail flows, most of it is coming from the credit card businesses, the slippages. having said that, we have 24% of our base has revolvers and 16% alop or emi based customers. so 40% of the base either is revolving or alop-related emi customers. on the second question part of your question, well, how many customers are with 3 to 4 credit cards, i don't have the ready-made answer. it may be in the data pack, but i don't recall that answer. so we will come back to you later on this answer. shubhranshu mishra: just one question, if i can squeeze in. what is the percentage of open market sourcing in credit cards? sumant kathpalia: what do you mean by open market sourcing, if you can? page 14 of 16 IndusInd Bank Limited January 31, 2025"

            "dialogue": "thank you. just a follow up question on the fall in take rate as well. overall, the unit economics seem to have suffered a bit on quick commerce. could you talk a bit about whether it was entirely due to the upfront costs of the network and warehousing? or were there factors related to marketing costs or subsidies, perhaps given out to match with the competitive activity in the space? akshant goyal: our marketing cost went up, as we have also mentioned in the letter. but when we say marketing, we mean the digital marketing cost which is below contribution but above adjusted ebitda. discounts are nearly zero in our business since we are a marketplace business, there are hardly any discounts funded by us on our platform. the other component of take rate is the delivery charges that we charge from customers. we have seen a slight decline there because of the market and the competition being where they are on the delivery fee. while the decline is not significant, but yes, it has partly contributed to the decline in take rate that you see. ankur rudra: thank you. just one last question on food delivery, if i may. can you share a bit of color on the food delivery growth momentum you're seeing? was it a lot worse in december? and was there any impact from the increased competitive activity in short-duration food delivery? one of your peers launched that. there's also a lot of cloud kitchens being launched by you and by competition on the 10- minute side. any impact of that on the food consumption based on what you've seen? akshant goyal: i don't think any of this has had a material impact on zomato restaurant aggregation food delivery business so far. all these initiatives (any form of 10-minute delivery in india today), are still at a very early stage and are not likely to move the needle at all, even if you aggregate and put them together. for example, at bistro, we are live in only a handful of locations. other forms of quick deliveries also are largely not cannibalizing the existing business, merely improving the experience. so, i don't think what you're saying in terms of focus on quick deliveries has anything to do with the slightly lower growth that we have seen in the business last quarter. ankur rudra: appreciate it. thank you. moderator: the next question is from the line of vivek maheshwari from jefferies. please go ahead. vivek maheshwari: hi, good evening team. i have a couple of questions. first is on the food delivery side. the newsletter mentions about broad-based slowdown, and this is a comment from other consumption-oriented companies as well. do you think for you as a company, or for this as a category, it will moderate further before it starts picking up? your letter mentions again that page 4 of 15 things are expected to pick up. What do you think? Because a lot of consumer companies are talking about urban seeing more moderation in the foreseeable future before it gets better? What is your take?"

We will see the impact of increased competition on the cost of presenting ourselves to the customer, which is primarily our digital marketing cost today. And because there will be more competition over there, we expect this number will go up. But that doesn't impact how we look at our business or what we prioritize, which is essentially the things which drive the retention for us."

            "dialogue": "got it. thank you and wish you all the best team. moderator: the next question is from the line of swapnil potdukhe from jm financial. please go ahead. swapnil potdukhe: hi, thanks for the opportunity. my first question is on blinkit. earlier, we used to provide a data point stating that it took approximately two months for a store to reach 1,000 orders per day. i would just like to know the time it now takes for the newer stores, which have been opened in recent months, to reach this number, as this is the point where we typically become contribution positive. additionally, does the densification of our store network in some cities directly impact the throughput of existing stores due to cannibalization? akshant goyal: hi, swapnil, on your first question, there is broadly no material change in terms of the breakeven point compared to what we had shared earlier. if there is, we will certainly inform all the investors and update them. but as of now, we\u2019re still operating within the same ballpark, seeing store breakeven in around two to three months. this answer also relates to your next question. some of this also depends on what that new store represents. is it in a new area, a new city, or an additional store in an existing neighborhood? however, for the overall aggregate group of new store additions, that timeline hasn\u2019t changed at this point. and yes, you're right. if you open a store in an existing area, it doesn\u2019t necessarily cannibalize the existing sales of an existing store, but it does lead to a slowdown in the ramp-up of that store. hence, it reduces the utilization of the network, and thereby slightly drags down the margin in the short term. however, it builds more capacity for future expansion and assortment expansion. swapnil potdukhe: okay. by any chance, do you have any ssg (same-store sales growth) numbers that you can share for some of the more mature stores and how they are tracking? akshant goyal: see, again, as i said, ssg will not make sense here because we are still adding stores in the same neighborhood. so, if i open a new store in the same neighborhood, the first store's ssg will actually not make sense. therefore, maybe the right metric to look at is the ssg of a polygon or a neighborhood. page 6 of 15 We do track that data internally, but it is not publicly shared at this point. However, what I can share with you is that the SSG is quite healthy because most of the network is still underutilized from a capacity standpoint. Additionally, from a demand standpoint, our penetration in the market is still low. Hence, as we add more categories and as we extend our marketing reach to more customers, we are seeing a fairly healthy SSG at the polygon level."

            "dialogue": "got it. and the second question is with respect to your category addition, as you mentioned some categories like electronics, high value electronics, maybe laptops, i saw somewhere. how do you account for the high mrps in aov. do you consider the mrp as aov when it comes to this kind of electronics? or do you take the commission income, which was, i think, in the case of mobile phones, you used to take the commission income in the aovs? and does that have a correlation to your aov increase for this particular quarter? akshant goyal: swapnil, it's a good question. so, outside of the f&v category, where we account for the selling price as the aov, outside of that, for all other categories, the mrp is counted in the definition of aov, and that definition is there in our letter, and it is disclosed. however, as we are seeing the share of products where the delta between mrp and what the brand and seller are selling at is increasing in our business, we are considering disclosing more data from next quarter onwards, which can help shareholders and investors understand the actual customer-paid aov as well as the gross aov that we are currently reporting. swapnil potdukhe: got it. and then later, you mentioned that your growth investments will continue on blinkit. now, should we see your absolute losses increasing hence forth? or should we expect the percentage number to come down a bit? any trajectory-wise guidance would be helpful here. akshant goyal: at this point, again, we don't want to give more guidance than what we've already given, swapnil. i hope you'll appreciate that, given the market is dynamic and competitive, so, we'll see. but directionally as we have mentioned in the letter, we do expect the investments in blinkit to go up. and as a result, the losses on an absolute basis are expected go up in the next one or two quarters. swapnil potdukhe: got it. and just one last question on food delivery as well. we have been hearing that some of the restaurants are renegotiating their take rates, the commission rates, with you guys. i think your take rates have not meaningfully increased this quarter despite the significant increase in platform fees. that benefit has not reflected in your reported take rate. is this because you are renegotiating those commissions? akshant goyal: not at all. commission renegotiation is a part of our business; it happens every day, every quarter. so, there\u2019s nothing special that we are aware of in this quarter. page 7 of 15"

            "dialogue": "got it. okay. thanks a lot, guys. all the best for future. moderator: the next question is from the line of yogesh aggarwal from hsbc. please go ahead. yogesh aggarwal: hi guys. i have a couple of questions. firstly, on the top 50 stores, which are obviously mature stores and have a very high throughput and a contribution margin of 6.4%. is this the peak we can expect, or is there potential for the contribution margin to increase even for these stores? if so, what factors would lead to further expansion, if any? akshant goyal: i don\u2019t think this is the peak. even for the more mature stores, there is a fair bit of cost that we are paying due to operating in a competitive market, which impacts the delivery fee that we charge consumers and the last mile cost that also applies to these stores. so, all of that in long term will change. as the business scales, our gross margins or sourcing margins should improve, and so should our ad income. the contribution margin, the way we define it, also includes a lot of fixed costs, which are fixed in nature, including back-end warehousing costs, employee costs, and so on. there\u2019s a fair bit of room for the contribution margins to go up from where you see the top 5% stores are today to where they could be, let\u2019s say, 2 to 3 years down the line. yogesh aggarwal: okay, good. the second question is on densification. as you said, the bulk of the new stores are more like network stores in similar cities. have you seen this result in lower delivery costs? because i'm hoping that the delivery radius has come down across larger cities. has there been an impact on delivery costs, or is that something we should expect in the future? albinder singh dhindsa: hi, yogesh. as densification happens, we do see delivery costs come down, which are primarily a function of the polygons of the stores becoming smaller. however, on an aggregate level, that delta, the rundown is a lot slower because we are also expanding. like you mentioned, with more than 30% of the network being new, when we open a new store, the polygons tend to be slightly bigger, especially if we are opening them in non-serviceable areas of the same city or in nearby cities. it's a combination of these factors. but to answer your core question, as we densify, the last mile cost does come down for us. yogesh aggarwal: got it. related to that at the store level, we've seen, at least anecdotally, that the rentals and picker salaries have gone up quite a bit. is this something that will moderate or normalize? or is that something you expected in the business model and therefore, it doesn't bother you? albinder singh dhindsa: that has always been the cost of doing business. it was fairly built into how we think about the business. we also believe that in some areas, there has been an unusual run-up, which we expect to normalize in the near term. yogesh aggarwal: great, very well. thank you so much. albinder singh dhindsa: thanks yogesh. page 8 of 15"

We're not operating with a fixed budget for expansion at this point, given that the market is very large, and we clearly see a first-mover advantage in reaching consumers first.

    "Kiran Thomas": "00:07:18 \u2013 00:21:29 (Digital Services) So, we want to start today with an update on the progression of our True 5G services. If you look at the chart on the right, you can see that it has been a story of steady growth. We already had the Pan India network up and running for the past many quarters. And now, thanks to the natural upgradation of devices happening in the market where a lot of the new handsets have 5G capability. And as soon as a customer acquires a 5G device, they automatically are able to enjoy all of the 5G services available through Jio True 5G. So, the combination of having that Pan India network available and the increasing adoption of 5G devices in our subscriber base has resulted in the number of Jio 5G subscribers crossing 170 million as on December 24th. Moreover, 5G now accounts for a large chunk of the traffic on our network. \u00a9 Reliance Industries Limited 2020 4 Nearly 40% of the wireless traffic of an overall traffic of about 15 exabytes is being contributed by 5G. And this story will continue to unfold into the future. And more interestingly, thanks to the fact that we have this superlative True 5G network, which is a big differentiator vis-\u00e0-vis other competitors, also means that any new 5G device that is sold in the market, 70% of them end up becoming a Jio customer and using Jio services. So literally, I think we are at the cusp where probably in a very short period of time we'll be able to say that probably one of the fastest 5G rollouts, not only 5G rollouts, but 5G adoption anywhere in the world, the total 5G traffic on our network will surpass the 4G traffic very, very shortly. Now, it is not just in the consumer side. We have also been briefing all of you over the last few quarters about True 5G, also powering something called Jio AirFiber. So, if you look at the pie chart on the left, what is heartening is that the availability of AirFiber has really opened up demand, unlocked demand or pent-up demand from beyond what we call the top thousand cities and towns of India. And what we are seeing is that as you know, nearly 70% of the population of the country is outside of what we call the cities or the urban markets. And now we are really starting to see that even our addition with respect to AirFiber connections are starting to reflect that mix. And more than 70% of the new connections are now starting to come from beyond the top thousand towns and cities. We also had more than 2 million connects in a single quarter in the third quarter of FY25, which has really driven the total connected premises to nearly 17 million. And just keeping in mind that this space is accelerating now as the rollout itself is kind of becoming almost a well- oiled machine. And with new demand getting unlocked from all across the country and not just urban centres, I think the pace of connections will pick up into the future. And we see that this entire greenfield opportunity of connecting 100 million plus homes across India is now getting that additional momentum thanks to AirFiber. And this is an area where we have a significant first mover advantage where essentially, we are going after hitherto unconnected or underserved markets with this offer. The enterprise business is also picking up momentum. If you look at year on year growth, there is a nearly three times or 280% year on year increase in all the large government tenders which have come out. And of course, if you look at both the national and state government connectivity infrastructure, we are continuing to increase our share in that segment. \u00a9 Reliance Industries Limited 2020 5 Another big segment which is modernizing is all the banks. And if you look at the recent past again, we've been consistently winning a lot of the connectivity tenders coming from cooperative banks. And we believe that there's the potential to get up to 150,000 bank branches across the country that we are well positioned to connect eventually. And of course, large corporates across as some of their traditional contracts are rolling off, we are getting selected as almost near exclusive service provider because most enterprises who have multiple locations and Pan India premise presence, they are looking to have a single solution provider. And Jio is well positioned to be that exclusive service provider on a Pan India basis. And wherever we have such demand coming in, we are seeing that we are the provider of choice there. In addition to connectivity again we are providing a true developer friendly platform as a service for connectivity. We call connectivity and communication platform as a service. The brand name is JioCx and in addition to that of course the IoT adoption again which requires Pan India connectivity. And of course, in the government sector through a few of the initiatives and wins that we have had. Also getting into private and hybrid Cloud as a managed service. So, across the board I think connectivity is obviously getting strengthened. But we are also now starting to see traction for services beyond connectivity. And also talking about communication, we launched recently the SIP business and 50% growth in the installed base in the first quarter itself post launch. If you look at what is now, I just want to talk about a few themes that we are pursuing into the future. So certainly, we are living in the age of AI. Dramatic transformations starting to happen across industries, across functions, across, even across various use cases. And to enable all of that to happen and making sure that India is emerging as one of the preeminent AI nations anywhere in the world. Again, we see ourselves having to pursue a few missions to support that ambition. And the first one is of course setting up national AI infrastructure, really looking at creating AI ready infrastructure, hard infrastructure and compute capabilities, not just in the few megawatts or even hundreds of megawatts, but really extending it to the gigawatt scale. Because we believe that this transformation will be across the board, and we need to be ready to ramp up and support the emergence of AI driven use cases in the country. \u00a9 Reliance Industries Limited 2020 6 And not just creating the scale, but also ensuring that we are able to deliver through various innovative partnerships and of course innovative initiatives internally to deliver one of the lowest cost inference capabilities when it comes to AI anywhere in the world. And this is a similar mission as compared to what we were able to do in broadband. So very excited by that. Internally I think we are seeing already multiple use cases where we are starting to weave that AI story across our operating companies in the Reliance Group. And of course, on the back of whatever we are doing here, eventually we will be then looking to offer this as a platform even for other enterprises in India. And if you are looking at what other offerings beyond the platform play, what are the offerings we are looking to take to market across the board, all of the consumer and small businesses and enterprise offerings that we're already providing in the market, all of them will see a lift thanks to the adoption of AI within all of those applications as well through multiple use cases. Looking at some of the AI related, not just AI, but across the board comprehensive suite of offerings that we unveiled in the India Mobile Congress 2024, which happened over the last quarter, I think building on the AI theme, a platform called JioBrain, which is really the plumbing on top of which we are able to rapidly spin up all of these AI use cases that I spoke about that was unveiled and showcased. We made an announcement and now it is available through a beta offering called AI Cloud, which is again an offering for the consumer. So that was also announced and showcased and now taking compute into the homes, which has always been an underserved market, again partly because homes are not connected, but partly also because of the high cost of having personal computers in the home. So now we showcased a solution called JioCloudPC which is effectively, and I'll talk about that in a slide shortly, but effectively a very low cost and pay as you go. Capability of having a personal computer, evergreen personal computer never needed to be upgraded, always the latest specs and pay as you go. You only pay for the time for which you are using that PC. Again, services for education again, using AI to power various, I would say personalized education use cases, AI for skill development. Again, how do you train beyond primary education? But once you get into the workforce, how do you use AI to continuously stay updated? Some use cases around how can farmers and other people involved in the agricultural sector use AI? And then of course many vertical focused solutions, especially when it comes to hospitality, retail, nursing and so on. And of \u00a9 Reliance Industries Limited 2020 7 course, unveiling a new benchmark when it comes to providing gigabit speed connectivity to every SMB. So, a combination of services but an increasing contribution being made by AI across all of these services. Some of them are already in the market and some of them we will be announcing the offerings being made available in the market very shortly. Now coming to the Jio AI Cloud offering that I spoke about. This is really a combination of putting connectivity, putting Cloud storage and AI into one package and making it available to Indian customers. Connectivity is a given. I think I mentioned both in the hand and in the home. The connectivity story is really unlocking new demand, but at the same time the existing constraint of having sufficient Cloud compute available to customers. We made an announcement of providing 100 GB free of cost. I think the earlier benchmark was either 5GB or 15GB depending on whether you were an Apple customer or Google customer through Android. But it kind of raised the bar multifold by providing 100 GB free of cost to all Jio customers. All of the features that one would expect to store, to share, to sync, secure. You can stream various kind of media assets all from the same app without having to use any other applications. Unlocking the content that you have onto the big screen through integration with our set top box. Trying to bring in additional content very easily. Like an integration with things like DigiLocker where if you have even government authenticated content and documents, very easy to integrate between Jio AI Cloud and that. And there are already a set of AI powered use cases where we are able to curate your content, make it available as memories on a daily basis as appropriate to significant dates or other events or other occasions. Ability to group individuals through face detection, multiple magic tools to convert your photographs into avatars and also edit those photographs by removing background, adding other assets into those content. All of that today already made available and we've just launched this as a beta offering in the market and in the coming Quarter we will look to scale this up to every Jio customer and beyond the JioCloudPC that I mentioned earlier. So really this is again a new frontier of adding to the lineup of digital services that we are taking to Indian homes. \u00a9 Reliance Industries Limited 2020 8 The key idea being that we already have a pretty capable set-top box in the home. So effectively we are converting that set-top box and your TV into a PC because the actual compute we are able to run in the Cloud and then all you need is a keyboard and a mouse and effectively your set top box and your TV in combination with the Cloud PC doubles up as a PC available to you on demand. And really, I think the key power that we are looking to provide to the home is to enable multiple work and learn and create use cases. So certainly, students today, not just for their classwork, but to develop skills like coding or media creation etc. Beyond what they're learning in their classroom certainly would require compute of some kind. And this we believe is going to be that. Gig workers who are working from home, etc. Again, they are creators of content and sometimes the phone or the tablet is not the best form factor for productive work. And again, this could unlock many such use cases. And again, we are providing 100GB of storage for every Cloud PC and as a basic capability an 8GB multi-core processor is already available through the Cloud to get you started. And again, like I said, it is always updated both in terms of hardware and software because all of that is in the Cloud. You don't have to really think about buying or upgrading that on your own. And there's no lock-in, there is no maintenance or anything. It's always available to you and you only pay for what you use. So, some updates that I had, and I'll just hand it over to now Anshuman to talk about both the operational and financial numbers for the quarter. Sh",
    "Anshuman Thakur": "00:21:30 \u2013 00:26:52 (Digital Services - Financials) Thanks everyone. A very happy new year. Coming to the quarterly highlights, both combination of tariff hike as well as scale up of some of the digital platforms and improving customer mix resulted in our operating revenues growing at 19.4% year on year going up to 33,074 crores. Corresponding increase in EBITDA as well at 18.8% year on year, 16,585 crores. So fairly healthy quarter, combination of a lot of things going on there and some of the digital revenues just about kicking in. Subscriber \u00a9 Reliance Industries Limited 2020 9 base at 482.1 million. So, we've as Kiran mentioned early on, we started getting the subscriber run rate picking up again 3.3 million subscribers getting added in this quarter and that number has been picking up through the quarter. The ARPU came in at 203.3 rupees per month; once again increase on account of the tariff hike which was done a quarter ago, but also improving customer mix and additional revenues coming in from some of the digital services. Home additions- we added almost 2 million new connections during the quarter and with an increasing run rate the Jio AirFiber product has been very successful in the market. We're seeing a lot of demand coming from towns and cities beyond the tier 2s. We already are at 4.5 million Jio AirFiber homes connected, and which will be fairly, you know the rate at which we are growing, we should be the largest air fiber service provider globally in the next few months. Customer engagement continues to be very strong. 350GB per capita monthly data usage and that also continues to grow quarter by quarter. Kiran spoke about the 5G interaction. Both the consumption and the subscribers are getting added every month and every quarter. We are the world's leading standalone 5G operator outside of China and we continue to be the world's largest data operator mobile company anywhere including when you consider the Chinese companies as well. On the trend in ARPU there's been a significant increase in ARPU over the last few years. Five-year CAGR is 10%. The full impact of the July 24 tariff hike- part of that impact has already played through in the last two quarters but full impact still playing out. As most of you are aware we have subscribers who are on longer term plans and who tend to recharge over a longer period of time and therefore we expect some more flow through to happen as well. And you know the affordability as well as increasing engagement should sustain both in the subscriber growth run rate as well as the ARPU growth in the coming quarters as well as you know a bunch of new services and facilities Kiran spoke about a few of those plus the media offerings that we're providing to our customers; we expect to further improve the customer wallet share that we have. The key operating matrices that we report to you every quarter - 482.1 million subscribers, net customer addition of 3.3 million during the quarter. So, we clearly saw a reversal of the trend that we had seen in the last quarter and an increasing run rate of customer addition. ARPU at 203.3 rupees; the total data consumption cross 46 exabyte for the quarter that continues to grow fairly healthily 32.3 GB per user per month, net subscriber addition of 3.3 million that we saw. Otherwise, per capita voice consumption also continues to grow over a thousand minutes per user per month of voice. So, data and voice traffic grew 22.2% and 6.5% respectively on a year-on-year basis. Coming to the RJIL financials, these are financials for our connectivity business. The operating revenues grew to 29,307 crores. That was a 15.5% year on year increase and the \u00a9 Reliance Industries Limited 2020 10 EBITDA growing a little bit faster coming to 15,798 crores. The EBITDA margin at 53.9%. This is only for the connectivity business RJIL, the connectivity service provider. And coming to the Key Financials for Jio Platforms Limited Consolidated Financials, the overall Q3 revenues came in at 33,074 crores, 19.4% year on year growth. We are seeing a very healthy increase in non-connectivity. The digital revenues which grew at 60% year on year. The annualized run rate has crossed 15,000 crores and this we are seeing very healthy growth trend here coming in with most of the growth coming in from new customers that we are able to serve. EBITDA increased to 16,585 crores consolidated EBITDA so the consol. EBITDA margin at 50.1% and Profit After Tax at 6,857 crore that was a healthy 26% year on year growth during the quarter. With this I'm going to hand over to Dinesh to take you through the results of operating and financial results for Reliance Retail. Sh",
    "Dinesh Taluja": "00:26:53 \u2013 00:41:15 (Reliance Retail) Thanks, Anshuman. Hi! Good evening, everyone. On the retail business, we had a very strong performance with Rs 90,000 crores of revenue during the quarter. So, milestone quarter for us, where our revenues crossed ten billion dollars in a quarter. The growth was 18.4% on a quarter, quarter basis, and 9% on Y-o-Y basis. Part of the growth came from the festive season and the wedding season, but also a lot of the streamlining and productivity improvements that we've been focusing on over the last few quarters that is coming to fruition, and we are seeing strong impact of that. EBITDA came in at Rs 6800 crores, 16.7% growth, quarter on quarter and nine and a half percent growth by Y-o-Y margin continues to expand at 8.6%. Our grocery business B2C business grew at 37% Y-o-Y. So, while there's a lot of talk about quick commerce growing, we see our business growing very strongly, with very healthy LFLs growing, as well as our Online Express deliveries business is also scaling up pretty well. We are a much higher scale compared to any other offline and online player. So, for us, the business continues to perform very well. Also in the fashion lifestyle business, which was impacted by few headwinds in the last couple of quarters that has seen a strong, strong turnaround, and we had a very strong festive quarter. There's there was growth across all operating metrics that we registered. So, our \u00a9 Reliance Industries Limited 2020 11 registered customer base was up 15% at 338 million, footfalls was up 5% and number of transactions was up 11% on a Y-o-Y basis. Our digital and new commerce continues to contribute. The contribution has remained steady at about 18%. We opened 779 new stores during the quarter. The total store count stands at 19,100. We continue to expand our partnerships. So, to address the super luxury segment in India, we entered into a franchise for India with Saks Fifth Avenue, which is a global luxury retailer. Also, in order to further strengthen the IP, we have done a joint venture with Mothercare PLC, where we own majority stake in the SPV, which owns the Mothercare brand for the Indian subcontinent. Now that gives us ownership of the IP and gives us a lot more flexibility to expand the range, source locally, as well as improve the margins. So, it is quite a positive for us. Quick summary: Revenue at Rs 90,000 crores, EBITDA at Rs 6800 crores, and profit after tax of Rs 3500 crores. So, as you can see, very strong growth sequentially, as well as on a Y-o-Y basis. Moving on to the some of the highlights across key businesses, electronics business had strong growth during the quarter. This was the festive and wedding quarter, where we see a lot of pickup in demand. We had strong 6% LFL growth. Our average bill values continue, continue to grow, as well as conversions are conversion rates of people coming to the stores is also improving. We had a strong festive quarter, one the what we measure the one week leading up to Diwali, we had a strong 12% of growth on a Y-o-Y basis. ResQ, which is the largest service organization for electronics and our biggest differentiator, that continues to expand. As you would recollect, we had launched on demand services three quarters back. We added it to 75 new cities where we offer the service. And now we are present in 225 cities for the services. And overall, we are present in over a 1000 cities. Our own brands business continues to launch new products. There were several launches which were done during the quarter. As well as, we continue to expand the merchant base, which was up 75%. 85% of this business is external distribution to the to the distribution net, general trade distribution network. And only 15% comes from our own, own channels. Our new B2B JMD business continues the growth momentum. Mobile phones continues to lead, be the dominant category in this business, and we are seeing both increase in merchant participation as well as the wallet share of merchant partners is growing which, which implies that they find our value proposition strong, and over a period of time, as we expand the \u00a9 Reliance Industries Limited 2020 12 distribution further right, increase the budget share this business would increase substantially. Next, On the apparel and footwear business, we had a very, very strong bounce back, partly the festival season, but also a lot of hard work that we had been doing on enhancing our design capabilities, improving the supply chain, the design to shelves, shortening the design to shelves cycle, using technology and AI, and improving the in- store customer experience. All of that is coming together and driving this growth. We are also adding new categories into our stores, adjacency so beauty and sleepwear, as categories, we have added across multiple store formats. Our three (3) recent store formats, which we launched last year, they continue to scale well, and the customer adoption is strong. We had the highest ever sales on all these formats during this quarter. Our own brands continue to grow, and their share continues to increase. Avaasa, Netplay, DNMX, these are the three largest brands. They are the amongst the leading brands in their respective categories, and they do drive a lot of footfalls in our stores. AJIO Business, the focus has been on, you know, improving the economics and improving the Average Bill Values and premiumize the offering. So that continues to do well. We have amongst the highest average bill values amongst all the online fashion platforms in the country. The Average Bill Value was up 7% on Y-o-Y basis. We added almost 2 million customers during the quarter. We continue to expand our catalogue, and we added over half a million options just in the first nine months of this year. The total catalogue now stands at 2.2 million. In this you know, you have to provide customers a wide range as well as exclusive, exclusive brands. So, most of our own brands that we have, whether the partner brands or our in-house brands, they're exclusive on the platform, and they do provide us a differentiation as well as better economics compared to other platforms, because if the customer has to buy, he has to come on to these platforms. We've also launched a bunch of new brands. There were 38 international brands and a host of other national brands, which were launched during the quarter. ON, Forever 21 and Saucony being some of the few. The Black Friday sale event, we had strong performance. There was a 17% growth Y-o-Y, and when we look at the number of people, we are reaching, the eyeballs the campaign reach was up 300%, which is a significant increase, because we are increasing the awareness of the platform and customer to recruit new customers. Our premium brands business, steady performance driven by the by the festive demand. We continue to strengthen our portfolio and launch new brands. So, on the in the F&B portfolio, \u00a9 Reliance Industries Limited 2020 13 we had Pret, and we had launched Aramani cafe last quarter. This quarter, we launched the EL&N cafe, as well as in premium side, we launched the Sandro brand. We also signed the India franchise for Saks Fifth Avenue to target the super luxury segment. In addition, the IPs that we own, right we want, we have stakes in a lot of designer brands. We are taking them global. So, for instance, Rahul Mishra and AKOK by Anamika Khanna, we are taking them to us through our partnerships with Saks, where they will be present in the iconic Saks New York store. Hamleys is a tourist destination driven business, and especially in Europe. We set up a third store in Italy, and we continue to expand in new markets. We spoke about the Mothercare IP. Jewels overall, I think the jewellery business has been kind of, the volumes have been impacted by the substantial increase in gold prices. We had a decent quarter, especially Dhanteras and wedding season, where we did have a lot of footfalls and reasonable growth in sales. We also continue to launch new collections. So, our Vivaham collection is meant towards the towards the wedding season, and we have done multiple phases of that, you know, variants of that collection over the periods. And this is a property that we have built. B2C, grocery was the star. The B2C business had a very strong 37% growth. The big box formats are kind of driving this growth. There is broad based growth across categories, the high margin categories, general merchandise, value apparel, as well as some of the premium categories in personal and home care and beauty, continue to do very well. We are continuously improving our assortment and premiumizing. The benefit of that is, one, it provides a differentiation for us in terms of customers getting premium assortment in our stores, it improves the Average Bill Values as well as the margins. So that's something that we focusing on. At every quarter and quarter, our average bill values are increasing, which is a big positive for the business. The Tyohaar Ready Sale, a marquee property that we have built targeting the festive season. There are various festive categories, which did very well. And remember, these footfall driver categories during the festival season. Metro, which is a B2B business, delivered its highest ever festival sales. This business is scaling up very nicely. We had a bunch of, you know, local events targeting various occasions to really drive engagement with the merchant, Kirana partners. Online grocery, I think three prong: one is the Express deliveries. So that's something that we are accelerating our presence. The big advantage we have is we have stores across the length and breadth of the country. We are today providing Express deliveries across 4000 \u00a9 Reliance Industries Limited 2020 14 pin codes through our network of 2100 plus stores, spread across a large spectrum of cities, from where we are able to deliver within 30 to 45 minutes from our stores. And we are looking to crunch that timeline even further. Compared to any other, any other e commerce up there, the big advantage we have is that we ride on the existing infrastructure. From a customer value proposition, they get much wider assortment. We don't charge a delivery fee and a host of other benefits in terms of best pricing in the industry. So, there's a very strong proposition for the customer. And for us, the unit economics are much better than anybody else, given that we are leveraging the existing network, rather than setting up a high-cost dedicated network for this business. Also, given the width of offering we have, our AOVs are amongst the highest in the industry, because we are able to offer the full range across regional merchandise, electronics, fashion. That really helps us drive the average order values. The second part is the subscription business. We continue to grow this business very nicely. It's a premium service business where we people actually pay for delivery, and you have to go micro market by micro market, capture it city by city. And we are steadily increasing the presence of this business. The third part is, you know, these are our inventory led models to fill any gaps so that a customer can have the widest choice. We continue to add 3P sellers, so we can offer the entire range to the to the customers, and we continue to add new sellers onto the platform. And there was a big push on the Festival event to acquire customers, as well as push new categories. And you know, during the festival season, we saw one and a half x growth in GMV during that period. Consumer brand business is scaling up exponentially. In the nine months FY 25 \u2013 this is our FMCG business \u2013 we had revenues upward of Rs 8000 crores. Two of our most prominent brands Campa and Independence, they continue to gain traction. Each one of them individually should cross Rs 1000 crores turnover in FY25. Campa has already gained 10% market share in the sparkly beverage category in select states. The focus here is three pronged expand distribution in the priority states, strengthen our product portfolio through innovative products and partnerships, products which are meant for the Indian market, for the Indian consumer, that differentiates us from competition, as well as build a robust supply chain, where I can have the widest presence at the lower supply chain cost. Now that we also have a critical presence in terms of distribution and supply chain, we are also starting to invest in marketing and promotions to really create brand salience, which will accelerate the presence of this business even further. \u00a9 Reliance Industries Limited 2020 15 So, all in all, a very strong quarter, I think the business is well positioned. There are several businesses doing exceedingly well, and we're optimistic that going forward, quarter on quarter, we should show healthy growth, coupled with all the, you know, all the productivity improvements that we've done. I think we are well positioned in the coming quarters. With that, I'll hand over to Sanjay for oil and gas business. Sh",
    "Sanjay Barman Roy": "00:41:17 \u2013 00:46:28 (Hydrocarbons - Exploration & Production) Thanks, Dinesh. Very good evening to all of you, and very happy new year. Just as a recap of the quarter gone by, so this was a steady quarter. We saw revenue at about $744 million, or about Rs 6370 crores, which is a slight upside from the previous quarter of around 2.5 percent. EBITDA came in at about Rs 5,565 crores, again, about more than 5% increase quarter on quarter. EBITDA margins were very healthy, it grew by almost 240 basis points to 87.4%. The key drivers, we saw an uptick in CBM production based on multilateral wells. Currently, 34 wells have been put on stream out of the 40 originally planned wells. So, we are seeing a production of about 0.35 million standard cubic meters, which is quite encouraging. And the perspective is that we will continue to drill multilateral worlds as these are highly capital efficient and delivering better results. KGD6 performance has been steady in terms of production, about in overall. BCFT terms, 68.5 In MMSCMD terms, we are about 28.0 4 million standard cubic meters and about 21,000 barrels of condensate per day. Now, the marginally lower production has been offset by higher price realizations in KGD6. Again, the ceiling price prevailing during this half is $10.16 per MMBtu, and we are realizing slightly higher values, which is $9.74. In CBM, we realized about 10.58, which is lower, but still quite healthy. The difference being here QoQ, prices were far elevated when you look at a year back. In terms of the parallel condensate barrel realization, we are seeing about 75.24 which is lower, simply on the back of lower rent prices prevailing during the quarter. Next slide please. \u00a9 Reliance Industries Limited 2020 16 So overall, we still remain a material contributor. We are from KGD6, we are generating slightly over 28 million standard cubic meters. And from CBM, we continue to increase the production. So, Reliance remains a major contributor to India's gas economy. So just to review the outlook for the gas markets, again, prices during the quarter hold around $13-15 per MMBtu. Mainly, the demand has been resilient, particularly in India, but there have been supply disruptions, mainly LNG terminal outages in Australia, event in terms of gas, wherein there was a stoppage of Russian gas Ukraine, which impacted almost 11 million tons per annum of supplies. Overall, in the short term, we expect prices to remain firm. There are delays in the LNG projects and the projects in Africa and Canada seem to be delayed, and that is going to have an overall impact of about 5 million tons in CY \u201825. Also, we see the storage is at much lower levels in Europe. They're seeing about 68.8% versus 5-year averages of 74.8. But if you compare it to last year, it was almost 84%. So, storage is at much lower level, so you expect higher coupling gas demand. Again, bodes well for elevated prices going forward. The Indian gas market has remained extremely robust. In fact, in CY \u201924 we saw a significant increase in consumption, almost by 10%. It almost it went up to almost 200 million standard cubic meters in the last quarter, mainly driven by city gas distribution, petchem. and power sectors. LNG Imports also saw a surge. Despite elevated prices, we saw the overall demand for LNG go up to almost 25.5 million tons per annum in CY \u201824 as compared to 21.1 million tons in CY \u201923. So that was quite an increase in demand, despite higher prices. Also, given ceiling price is better $10.16 per MMBtu us compared to the first half, which was $9.87. It bodes well for the price outlook for the current quarter. Thank you. Sh V. Srikanth 00:46:29 \u2013 01:04:54 (O2C Business, Summary and Closure) O2C performance, there are two sections, one is the quarterly review, and the other part of it is O2C looking beyond the near term. So, as you saw, the EBITDA for this quarter this quarter, Rs 14,400 crores, up 2.4% on a year-on-year basis. And significant resilience from an EBITDA standpoint, even given the markets that we saw. And of course, we benefited from higher volumes, that's up 9%. We \u00a9 Reliance Industries Limited 2020 17 benefited from the fact that, there was strong domestic demand and also, given that we were able to place a lot of our fuel in the domestic markets. Also, the continuing advantage of ethane cracking verses naphtha as you know, the cost are almost $300 a ton more, from an advantage standpoint. We also benefited to some extent, with the polymer deltas, which were up between one and nine percent across these products. The fuel cracks were healthy, did come off significantly from what it was last year. So, this performance, in a way, offsets the 15% fall in gasoline. It offsets the 38% fall in across gasoil and ATF, and also it offsets the polyester chain margins, which are lower on a year-on-year basis, at 12%. On a Q-o-Q, which I touched upon, strong rebound that, 16% higher, and that benefited from recovery in mid distillates, especially gasoil and ATF were up 11% to 13%, polypropylene prices were up by 5% and PVC by 4%. So, all in all, this helped, you know the quarterly boost, and effectively our EBITDA margins improved 160 basis points to 9.6%. So, on the operating performance for the quarter, the production meant for sale was close to 18 million tons, and this is 9% higher than what it was last time. And we continue to focus on some of the things we do in terms of, for example, in the case of prioritizing transportation fuel versus aromatics. And given the environment for aromatics, it made sense for us to prioritize production of transportation fuel. As I mentioned, we focused a lot on domestic fuel sales, given the demand. Also, a lot of cost optimization measures were taken, using larger vessels for delivering and for loading and for product placement. Also focused lot of attention on using FO for minimizing our fuel cost for the Jamnagar Complex during periods when they were low gasifier availability. So, quick snapshot - market environment. Average Brent Crude prices, when you look at it, 11% fall year-on-year and 7% down on a quarter-on-quarter basis, on the back of stronger dollar, weakness in China and higher non-OPEC production, which kept the markets very well supplied. The US Ethane prices were lower by 3% year-on-year, benefiting us, because of cracking ethane and also the operating rates in the US were higher this time because of some of the crackers, which were under shutdown, came back into production. Oil demand still is 1.5 million higher on a year-on-year basis, primarily led by Asia, ex-Japan, as well as we saw a EU demand being higher, and also the fact that gas prices were firm helped keep the demand for oil also firm. And on the transportation fuel side, gasoline demand we saw was up about 0.4 million barrels per day at about 26.9, diesel was broadly flat and jet/kero demand was actually higher by 0.5 \u00a9 Reliance Industries Limited 2020 18 million at about 8 million barrels per day, and primarily Asia Pacific, contributing for more than half of it. On the specific cracks, year-on-year, fall in gasoil was on the back of China demand, as well as the fact that US refineries had a record production there. For third quarter, the benefit, as I talked about earlier, was domestic demand was up 9.6% at about 10 million tons on the back of demand for PV and two-wheeler sales. There was a lot of momentum there in passenger vehicles. For us, the focus was on really pushing domestic sales, as I mentioned, retail volumes are up 44% supported by some specific schemes, like \u2018Happy Hour\u2019 petrol scheme. And as I mentioned, you know, prioritizing of gasoline versus automatics meant that we had more volume to sell in gasoline. We think that near term outlook, given Chinese Spring Festival and Ramadan, could keep the near-term outlook positive. On diesel, again, the weakness we saw attributable to China as well as the inventories were higher. Quarter-on-quarter the cracks did improve to $15.1/bbl on the back of lower China exports and India\u2019s domestic demand year-on-year was up 5% at about 24 million tons. Similar to gasoline, focus has been on stronger domestic product placement. And for us, retail volumes are up 23% in this space. Near term dynamics - heating oil demand and high gas prices could keep diesel constructive in the near term. In ATF directionally, cracks year-on-year fell in line with gasoil cracks but improved sequentially because of holiday demand. Specifically, in India we saw ATF demand grew 9% on a year-on-year basis. And for us, if you look at what air-bp Jio recorded in terms of growth, it was 51% compared to an industry growth of 9% so that has been very profitable. And near-term dynamics again look positive with Chinese New Year and as well as the Mahakumbh in India could possibly support demand. PE has been fairly stable year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter. So, for us, the benefit has come because of higher use of the assets that we had. And we tried to maximize light feed cracking so as to keep the margins there. Near term demand continues to be good for PE, when you look at demand for packaging and the broader overhang of incremental global capacity additions will continue to weigh on. \u00a9 Reliance Industries Limited 2020 19 PP deltas were up 9%. Domestic demand, pretty strong, 16% growth that we saw across consumer durables, packaging. We benefited, this time from improved asset availability, and from a near term point of view, the upcoming expansions on BOPP films will support demand for PP. PVC, delta improved by 12% year-on-year. That was mainly on the back of falling EDC prices. PVC domestic demand, as you can see, was up 16% led by agri and infrastructure. Specifically, for PVC our actions have been on, freight cost reduction, emphasis on premium grades. That's what we have focused on and with benefits coming through overall demand. The demand for PVC will continue to be supported because of agri and infrastructure growth. Polyester chain delta down 12% primarily led by PX fall of almost 47% so that's one of the drivers. While, downstream polyester margins did improve, it did pull the overall chain delta 12% lower. And for us, the focus was on synergizing the polyester production across all the acquired sites, to address the strong festive demand that we saw. And also, by having a common marketing approach, we maximized both sales as well as margins. And on the cotton versus PSF, that margins continue to be good so long term the demand for PSF will remain strong. So, just put all these things together, you can see that even though deltas have been mixed, in fact, a lot of arrows downwards, but significantly offset by the fact that we had volume increases in each of these products, as well as the fact that the domestic demand has been pretty strong. O2C Looking Beyond Near Term I just wanted to lay the context, and you can see the last five years have seen significant reductions in margins \u2013 anywhere between 30% to 70% \u2013 across refining, polymers, and polyester. At the same time, it is also has come with significant volatility in the earnings. We know the factors. It was COVID. It was large capacity additions. It has been war in Ukraine. It has been the war in the Middle East. This has been the broader environment. So again, in that context, if you see our margins, our own performance has been, I would say, very resilient and with also lower volatility. And the investments that we made in light feed cracking pre-COVID, be it ethane sourcing and shipping, or building the refinery off-gas cracker, has ensured that we have had significantly better economics than what is implied by the naphtha-based margins of the previous slide. We also, if you may recall, our gasification investment contributed very positively when LNG markets were dislocated after the Ukraine \u00a9 Reliance Industries Limited 2020 20 war. Also, the continuing focus on the high growth domestic market in the domestic petrochemical downstream. And you know, these markets have grown anywhere between 8%-10%. So that has also meant for us higher asset utilization, as well as margins. When you go into the future capital investment plan, that I will talk about in the next slide or two, and the return to mid-cycle margins and refining and petrochemicals, does make us have a constructive view on O2C growth into the future. Before getting into the expansion projects, it will be helpful to see what is happening in terms of these two products. I'll not go through in detail, but except to say that when you look at polymers across PE, PP, PVC, and where it is going \u2013 be it packaging, automobiles, infra, agri, healthcare \u2013 for each of them, if you look at the demand drivers \u2013 and that is something that is extremely visible to all of us \u2013 packaged products, food ordering, the growth of retail and E-commerce, when it comes to packaging. In automobiles, you're seeing vehicle sales, you know, the demand for personal mobility and the need for light weighting, etc. On infrastructure side, you can see the thrust on infrastructure projects. It is propelling cement demand and therefore packaging there, and again, higher electricity consumption, again, making the need for wires and cables. In agriculture, focus on micro irrigation, government schemes. All of them are playing a big part in terms of having the demand for these products. On healthcare, again a lot of awareness and lot of demand. So yes, even if you were to look in the longer-term perspective, last three years demand volume growth has been closer to 10%. More importantly, looking into the future, this kind of demand environment remains intact. On the polyester side between PET and PSF, if you look again in terms of applications \u2013 beverages, textiles, home furnishing, automotive, nonwoven, industrial \u2013 each one of them have demonstrated last three years about 8% growth. But again, looking into the future, it presents a very constructive view for demand for these products. Against this backdrop our strategy has always been to invest in high growth our domestic markets. We have been very focused in each of these projects on capital allocation. We have always invested at the bottom of the cycle, and this is the time to take advantage of lower project cost. When margins are low, it's a good time to invest. And our continuing focus on scale, on flexibility, on integration, on newer technologies will remain as we invest in these projects. So, against this, if you see, what are we investing in? And, you know, starting with vinyls, with this 1.5 million tons PVC and CPVC facility at Dahej and Nagothane. This caters to a growing \u00a9 Reliance Industries Limited 2020 21 and a large deficit Indian market. As you know, the current deficit in India is between 2-2.5 million tons, even as we talk. So, this project helps address that gap. And from a size point of view, from the 22nd player globally, in terms of our current capacity, we would become the top 10 producers. Also, I have been emphasizing a lot about light feed cracking, and you know, for us, we are expanding the virtual ethane pipeline. We currently have six ships, and we are adding three more VLECs. That will help enhance the cost competitiveness of our cracker. Finally, on the polyester side, with a million tons of specialty polyester capacity, and matched 3 million tons of PTA, will help sustain the growing demand there. So when you look at it together, you know some of our points about having high quality assets, which are vertically integrated, and having the diversification of products, and cost profiles being in the top 10 or top quartile \u2013 either be it refinery or cracker \u2013 and combine that with the market presence in India and the deep distribution that we have, the financial flexibility for us in terms of existing businesses, robust cashflows helps us invest in this downside. And so, when you put this together, the point I was making about being constructive on O2C growth into the future, is something that we see. We see this business that on that trajectory. Just summarizing all the presentations that have been done thus far. So, we had record consolidated earnings both year on year, as well as sequential and with now consumer businesses accounting for 52% of our segment EBITDA. On the energy side, domestic market remains very strong, and with all the momentum and economic activity, and also, there has been recovery in fuel cracks with stronger demand in APAC region including India. Our operating model mitigated impact of weak downstream margin environment. On consumer side, strong festive and wedding season demand. But importantly, you know, I've been emphasizing over the last few quarters that focused a lot on operational streamlining and all that you are starting to see the benefit, and we remain confident about that it is behind us. And you know the constructive outlook for retail is very much now intact. Jio is seeing the benefit of the tariff hikes, and you're seeing the very strong traction on the customer addition side, both and especially on homes, and also the broader digital services \u00a9 Reliance Industries Limited 2020 22 earnings growth, which was touched upon. So overall, it has been, as I said, a strong operating quarter and strong performance across all our businesses. Thank you. \u00a9 Reliance Industries Limited 2020 23"

So, value-added services in the form of insurance OPD, My Good Doctor\u2019 facilitation, and more partnership with financial services companies that we don't have to incur the cost, but we will have a revenue strength."

                    "dialogue": "so, while there are headwinds from bangladesh, i think we have to remember that apollo fortunately is present in many markets. and this gives us access to different catchments. currently, we are at 68%, but we are hopeful that we should improve to 72%, 73% before the new beds open out. and by then, we would have found some level of replacement for the bangladesh revenues and volumes, in terms of other foreign markets. madhu? madhu sasidhar: yes. so, i think to add to what ms. suneeta said, i would say broadly that occupancy is probably not a perfect metric to measure us by, because there are so many numbers that go into it. for example, especially in our top 6 units, where we have a significant occupancy and a bed constraint issue, we worked very hard to drive down the length of stay. so, the right metric is inpatient volume. and as we've stated before, while the volume overall has grown up by 5.4%, congo volume is up by 10.3%. and even though we are doing more complex cases, we've actually, as a group, driven down our length of stay from 3.34 to 3.29, and this is very intentional on our part. a lot of this is the operational efficiency that ms. suneeta talked about. some of this is enabled by health it. so, we'll continue to work on our efficiency, so that we operate in the right level of occupancy to make us efficient and for patient experience. shyam srinivasan: that's helpful. and just a second question on the arpob dynamics, right. so, we have seen an improvement in q3 related to a year-to-date run rate of about 5%. we have seen 7%, 8%. so, is this now sustainable, we think, in terms of should we go back to our historical 6% to 7% kind of cagr on arpob? and some of the changes that we have tried to either in terms of mix or pricing, will that now sustain in the path forward? a. krishnan: yes, shyam, i think that's correct. you should consider it to be around 6% to 7%. i think that's a fair number to consider going forward. shyam srinivasan: understood, sir. thank you, all the best. moderator: the next question comes from the line of rajit aggarwal from nilgiri investment managers private limited. rajit aggarwal: in your retail health & diagnostics and digital health & pharmacy distribution, just to understand your medium-term plan or strategy, the way you are looking at these businesses. let's say in 3 years' time, how do you think these businesses would have ramped up, retail health in terms of turnover and margins, and digital health in terms of margins? just for my understanding how to build something for the next 3 years, i am not asking for a specific guidance as such. suneeta reddy: so, retail health, physical formats is with apollo health & lifestyle. so, i'll ask sriram to start answering that question, and madhi to chip in on digital. sriram iyer: yes. so, this question is specific to diagnostics or overall retail health? rajit aggarwal: overall retail health. sriram iyer: yes. so, as you saw in ahll, right, so we have 3 verticals, right. primary care and diagnostics is one, then we have specialty formats, and then that comprises the transcript of ahel q3 fy25 earnings call page 9 of 17 entire AHLL. So, we are growing at about 15% YTD. And I think, as Suneeta madam had also shared, and YTD also, we are at 15% growth. We look to keep the growth rate between 15% to 18% for the next couple of years, primarily driven by the momentum in diagnostics. So, diagnostics is one area, along with clinics, where we are betting on for the future. Clinics also has a lot of diagnostics revenue within the setup. And these are the 2 business units, we will be really pushing a lot to get us to the 15% to 18% growth mark for the next few years. That will help us draw our topline and also subsequently help us drive the better margins as well."

We hope to again expand that dramatically. So, between these 3 businesses, which are our core business, we are reasonably confident of doing around 20% growth rate. I'll come to the margins separately. The Insurance business, which we hope to begin in the coming year, would start maybe a bit slowly, but by the end of Q3, we should have a recurring revenue, which will be contribution to the margin structure. They might not support us on the growth, but on the revenue side, it would be a big flow. For margin, can I ask Sanjiv as to how the margin structure will play out, please?"

Our Diagnostic business is in the range of around INR 30 crore to INR 35 crore every quarter. We intend that to grow next financial year. And then we have the Consult business, which is predominantly driven by both the Outpatient business as well as the Inpatient business that we are able to drive. This has been a bit flat this quarter because of muted growth. So, all put together, instead of INR 4,000 crore, with a much better quality of business, we will be ending up at around INR 3,100 crore. And we will recalibrate our business on these lines. Like I told you, the emphasis is on breakeven. And once the insurance comes in, I think our revenue mix will look much better."

            "dialogue": "sir, in the -- as per the annual report, we manufactured close to 59% of the products that we have sold last year. and this number increased from 49% in fy '23. now given that margins on the manufactured goods are higher than the private products, ideally the company-driven margins should have increased in fy '24, i think which was not the case. so could you elaborate something on that, please? ashish saraf: sure. so if you look at financial year '23, right, we were significantly impacted by the global inflation, right, which kind of started somewhere in 2022 and kind of continue in the entire 2023 as well, right? so we took significant pricing actions in the market, right, where we were able to get better pricing from our customers in financial year '23 whereas in '24, the financial actions - - pricing actions have relatively stabilized, right? so our margins on the traded products were relatively much higher in financial year '23 vis-\u00e0- vis financial year '24, right? that's where when you look at even though our manufacturing mix went up to almost 60% in financial year '24, our overall margins for financial year '24 was relatively pretty much in line with what we experienced last year. hopefully that answers your question, right? harshit patel: yes, sir, that answers, sure. sir, secondly, on our railways portfolio, out of our overall railways and metro sales, how much is imported? and how much is manufactured by the sister unlisted company? i believe we wouldn't have been manufacturing anything in the listed entity for this particular segment? ashish saraf: for the railway segment, you are right. railways is almost -- a significant portion of it is already ruralized in india, but is manufactured by the unlisted company and is subsequently sold to skf india, which eventually move themselves into the end customer. harshit patel: sir, if you could broadly speak about the share between the imports vis-\u00e0-vis, the unlisted entity from where we source these railway products, then that will be... ashish saraf: the majority of it is sourced from the unlisted company, right? again, i don't have the exact number with me, but i would say almost 80% is sourced from the unlisted company, and the balance 20% is sourced from other skf companies. harshit patel: understood, sir. sir, just one clarification on the margins part. is the understanding correct that trading margins will always make certain positive ebitda on all the traded products, irrespective of whether manufacturing entity is making the loss or even very high profit. would that understanding be correct? ashish saraf: that is right. so for the traded products, skf india acts a limited risk distributor, right, where the margins for the -- for skf india is calculated under the transfer pricing guidelines, which is the net margin method, right, which ensures that skf india kind of makes reasonable margin on the products that it is selling, even though the actual margins might be way higher or we might be selling at a loss as well. moderator: the next question is from the line of mumuksh mandlesha from anand rathi institutional equities. page 4 of 15 SKF India Limited August 14, 2024"

            "dialogue": "hi, sir, mumuksh here. thank you so much for the opportunity and congratulations to mukund sir on your new role. sir, just first on broader level, how are you seeing the demand side, particularly on auto replacement and on the industrial sides, whether railways will drives -- whether the demand augurs more bullish. can you indicate how the demand trends are there, sir? mukund vasudevan: so i can answer that. it's -- so let's start with the automotive side. overall, i think automotive is a mixed bag, while the 2-wheeler and tractor segment is continuing to see some growth, especially 2-wheelers. the passenger vehicle and commercial vehicle has been relatively flat. passenger vehicles, inside passenger vehicles, we are seeing a little bit of a shift towards larger vehicles, suvs kind of things. of course, though the volume is small, evs is both in 2-wheelers and 4-wheelers is growing a bit -- is growing faster. so i'd say, demand-wise, mixed bag in automotive. industrial, we are seeing all the infrastructure-led segment growing well, which are heavy metals, heavy being cement and a few others, metals and correspondingly aftermarket also, right? we are seeing decent demand from wind and railways, but we are trading very cautiously there mainly to preserve our margins because i expect -- price expectations there are quite low. so broadly, that's kind of where we see. but we are very diversified, as ashish mentioned in terms of our split of segments. so we're able to play the economic cycles much better. mumuksh mandlesha: got it, sir. so i mean just on the wind and railway, just can you explain me more what kind of price challenge is there in this market with railways, sir? mukund vasudevan: i think it's driven by -- in wind, the pricing of -- it starts with the end-to-end user pricing, which has been low. so since these are all driven by end user price options, reverse options. so we -- that trickles down to the oems who are supplying equipment to the epcs who are building the wind farms. so the price pressure start from the -- all the way from the auction of setting up wind farms, all the way back to us as equipment -- as component suppliers to equipment to manufacturers. so that's the reason for the price pressures there. it's just very, very competitive, both for the oem and for us. so we selectively play there. we pick even within -- there's multiple bearings which go within a windmill, and we pick the ones where we clearly have an edge when we can get the price expectations of product -- a better product demand. on railways, it -- again, it varies. we have fairly high share in some of the high-speed trains, which are being introduced like vande bharat and things like that, metros. on freight, it is a lot more competitive, and that goes largely with l1 auctions as is norm normally in any government projects. and there, we are facing increasing price pressures. mumuksh mandlesha: got it, sir. so would the segment would still be in positive growth side sir, railways and wind, sir? mukund vasudevan: for us? or are you saying overall? mumuksh mandlesha: for you, sir? page 5 of 15 SKF India Limited August 14, 2024"

            "dialogue": "so basically what you're saying that we are trying but to retain the market share, but it seems that the counter feed products or the unorganized sector seems to be growing faster in the ball bearing segment than the organized sector? or is it the correct way to understand? mukund vasudevan: i don't think the data is that clear on that. but our -- i would say this is an anecdotal or information, which we are hearing in the -- hearing through talking to various customers. there is some uptake in, i would not say fake bearings, but in terms of unbranded -- or unbranded bearings, but that is something we continue to watch out for. and i don't think it will be a big needle mover. some segments in the market may go for either fake or unbranded, but we continue to watch those and see what we can do to kind of recover those customers or eliminate the fakes -- the source of the fakes. mayank bhandari: okay. and sir, lastly, you also mentioned that the renewable energy seems to be -- i mean, you're kind of integrating it into your factories, wind, solar and all, you're doing capex in the pune factory for renewable energy. so is there any number you can give us in terms of what will be the cost savings going forward in terms of once the projects are completely executed. mukund vasudevan: so i'd say the first step is just around sustainability. i think today, we are at around 45% is of what we -- energy we use is renewable. we're continuing to move that needle. that number has gone up by almost 10 percentage points over last year. so we continue to move that needle. in terms of cost savings, we'll have to come back to you with the exact numbers with how much cost savings we have seen so far, right. we'll come back to you with the numbers if you send us an e-mail. moderator: the next question is from the line of krupashankar from avendus spark. krupashankar: i have a few questions. first one, on your commentary in annual report stating back by fy '30, would like to double your revenues. i just wanted to get a sense that are we looking for any specific sectors beyond the traditional core sectors, which we have been operating in india? and like we have said with respect to exports and new opportunities coming up, is there any further avenues where this growth can be higher over the next 4 to 5 years? some comments on that. mukund vasudevan: okay. so i think there are always segments where we will see higher growth. so -- and we're continuing to look at those. so while i'll just point out a couple of examples. one is from the automotive side, evs are faster growth. we have bearings, which are both hybrid and ceramic range, which are more suited and we have higher market share internationally also. so as the ev market grows, we expect to get more share and grow faster in those segments. that's one. we already mentioned the high-speed trains. then there is also as india is investing more in things like semiconductors manufacturing and that will be part of our strategy up to 2030. we will -- we clearly have products which are much better suited for that manufacturing process also. again, we can get better market share and we expect higher growth there. even within our traditional segments, if you subsegment even we have a larger category of general machinery, if you look at -- within general machinery, if you look at machine tools, for example, that requires high-speed and low friction bearings. that is an area of strength for us. page 13 of 15 SKF India Limited August 14, 2024 We will continue to look at that. So I'd say there's multiple areas where we can do better and where we have a product which is superior."

            "speaker": "Krupashankar",
            "dialogue": "understood. and on the export side of things also, if you can throw some light on whether there are opportunities beyond the korean transition, wherein indian ecosystem can be -- the manufacturing system can be much more suited for export opportunities. mukund vasudevan: yes. so we're continuously looking at opportunities to export. we are -- i would say there's a substantial opportunity within the region itself, within the southeast asia, australia, there's opportunities there where we can export. we are already exporting, but we'll continue to expand that. the other americas, also we do export. but most of these we sell to our parent entity, whether it's americas or europe, we sell to our parent entity. and there, it's purely a -- in what way can we be the most competitive, that's the decision -- that's how the decision is made. so as we get more competitive, we hope that we can get more of that volume also, and we'll continue to work on that. krupashankar: one more thing on some of the initiatives, which skf has taken in the past, for example, there were long-term contracts wherein skf had entered with sale for supplying bearings with sensors and identifying measures. so i just wanted to get a sense as to what would be -- this has been -- this effort has been running for almost 4 to 5 years now. so just wanted to get a sense on what's the extent of contribution of specific such contracts? and has it helped in predominantly customer retention and in many cases, has that increased the wallet share per se? mukund vasudevan: so there's many elements to services, right, and where you mentioned some of them like remote monitoring of our bearings, there is also what we -- that's what we call connected technologies. this is using iot devices to measure bearing noise, vibration, et cetera. we also have a reman, which is remanufacturing of bearings, which we do for railways and for some other heavy segments, which is basically using remanufacturing of bearing either refinishing it or replacing some portions of it so that it becomes more sustainable and it's more cost competitive, so -- but -- and extends life. so there are different elements. today, we are at around 5% to 6% of our business is services. we are looking to expand that because we are profitable, quite profitable, and we see more demand for it. as customers want more uptime or less downtime, and they want a full solution from the bearing manufacturer. it's something we're looking to do to continue to expand. specific to the example and sale, again, it's not something we share kind of share of wallet. but i would say every customer we get into, we are looking to kind of expand share of wallet. and where it makes -- where the customer is at gain from it. and we have delivered the value, which was expected. we do gain share. krupashankar: that's very helpful. last one, what would be the proportion of crb and srbs as a part of our total industrial mix, if at all, we can share a direction or approximate number? mukund vasudevan: give us a second. ashish saraf: so again crb data, i don't have specifically, right? but crb is around 25% of the products... page 14 of 15 SKF India Limited August 14, 2024"

            "dialogue": "okay. so the reason why i'm asking, sir, is that there is a sort of significant portion of new capacities you have coming on both from next year onwards. are you anticipating pricing pressure emerging because of dual capacity coming in the industry? or is -- we have a fair set of customer for probably a time frame of customer servicing due to which we can retain share? some thoughts on tax front as well. mukund vasudevan: i didn't understand your question. is your question, are we adding capacity just to satisfy demand? krupashankar: what i was trying to highlight here is that one of your peers is adding large capacities on crb and srb, and that is likely to be commissioned in the next year. is it likely to drive pricing pressure in that particular category? and how is skf looking to mitigate this transition or change in overall industry capacity? mukund vasudevan: i would say, look, we're also trying to localize as quickly as we can, both on crb and srbs. those are the 2 we mentioned or trbs, right? you mentioned. ashish saraf: yes, crb and srb. krupashankar: srb -- crb and srb, yes. mukund vasudevan: crb and srb, right. we are looking to localize more content there or more manufacturing there. i would say, there are strengths we have, there are strengths some of our competitors have. and we will continue to kind of evolve our product strategy to make ourselves not just more competitive, but to add more value to our customers. and i don't expect too much pricing pressure there, especially in areas of our strength. but i think it's -- like any other market it's a dynamic game, they -- competitors will make their moves, we will make our moves. and -- but i don't expect that there'll be a drastic pricing pressure just because of this. krupashankar: understood, sir. thank you and all the best. one humble request, please do continue engaging with investors on a continuous basis rather than once a year, that's my humble request. mukund vasudevan: i think we are out of time, moderator? moderator: shall we go for the closing, sir? mukund vasudevan: yes, please. so any further questions, you can e-mail and then we can respond. moderator: thank you. ladies and gentlemen, due to time constraints, that was the last question. we will now close the conference. on behalf of skf india limited, that concludes this conference. thank you for joining us, and you may now disconnect your lines. page 15 of 15"

On the CNG specific volume, just a minute, I will give you those numbers also. The CNG volume on an overall basis that is being contributed from the existing ones are close to about 1 million out of the 1.7 MMSCMD."

                    "dialogue": "okay. fair enough, sir. sir, second question related to sector, overall sector. the government has recently restored the apm allocation, as you mentioned, to the cng segment up to the 50%. do you see further restoration of apm gap to the cng segment? that's one. and, sir, we wanted to understand the rationale behind the restoration of this apm from the other segments like lpg or any other segment. going forward, if required, from where we can see the cng will get, cng will get apm gas? suresh manglani: so, what i have understood from last sentence \u2013 query. no, i'm just going to repeat. and if you say yes, basically, you are saying that since from 16 january, our apm gas allocation for cng has gone back to 51% roughly. you are seeking that whether it can go up further, if yes, but what is the timeline? is that your question? yogesh patil: that is the question. and on the top of that, just wanted to add one thing. what is the rationale behind to restore from other segments like lpg or any other power? i mean, we are not aware from which segment or the sector they have diverted a gap to the apm side. so, what is the rationale and logic that in long term we wanted to understand whether this is a sustainable or not, first of all? and i mean, that's the... suresh manglani: no, i understood your question. see, first of all, we need to understand that the vision of a government on cgd expansion and the development remains strong. so, this is one thing. so, that is the reason when the gas allocation went down or several constraints what government was working it out. what they did? while the apm allocation went down, they brought a solution of a new well gas, which has a priority for the cgd. similarly, we have hthp allocation as a priority for a cgd. higher prices, but there is a priority even though the spot prices may be much, much higher, but cgd are being given. so, that these actions will tell you that government has a strong vision for a continual development of a cgd sector. now, it has gone to 51% with certain measures which government took. now, what measures they are taking? that the lpg plant, the operators, and who are also the large like gail and ongc, they are actually taking the apm gas, which was part of a priority for extraction of lpg and the lean gas was being given to us. government view was that, since cgd has a first priority, let even that part be currently given benefit to the cgd. that is only rational because they saw that cgd's allocation has come down significantly to 37%-38%. so, that would put a lot of pressure on us at this winter period that we have to bridge the gap with a very high price gas. so, government had in mind that affordability of end consumers page 5 of 12 Adani Total Gas Limited January 27, 2025 should also be balanced. So, I think keeping in mind affordability of end consumers balancing, also seeing that which other areas government could help CGD sector is what is being done. So, that is the reason the 51% gas has been restored. Now, other industries so far has not been restored. Only LPG part has been restored, plus the new well gas is being given to us. That is the only current update we have. What we also understand from government that government is continually working on one, how much more APM gas could be given to CGD from what all measures could be taken, either industrial allocation or any other location. Second, what other help government could extend on supply chain aspect because we also have supply chain cost. So, I think there is a continuous engagement which is currently in place to make sure that there is a balancing approach on CGD gas, APM restoration or supply chain cost optimization. Similarly, ensuring that, like for example, if new well gas is coming, that also gets allocated to CGD."

                    "dialogue": "fair enough, sir. that was very useful. thanks a lot. moderator: the next question is from the line of sabri hazarika from emkay global. please go ahead. sabri hazarika: yes, good afternoon and congratulations on a good number considering the challenging situation. so, i just wanted - i just wanted i could not get it. you mentioned that right now the cng, i mean in q3 the cng sourcing mix was 47% was apm, 8% was new well gas and the residual is what did you mention i could not get it, hpht and other? rahul bhatia: yes, that hpht ceiling gas which comes from the kg basin. so, as you would be aware the volumes which are coming from there of the ceiling gas, even in that the government has accorded top priority to the cgd priority segment of cng and png domestic. so, all the auctions and bids which are done by ongc and the ril bp combined, in those bids the first priority of allocation is given to cgd. so, atgls has been bidding very aggressively for those ceiling gas volumes and about 25% of our entire portfolio today is hpht ceiling gas. sabri hazarika: 25% of cng or 25% of entire portfolio? rahul bhatia: 25% of our entire portfolio. sabri hazarika: okay. so, in cng how much it would be? any rough cut? rahul bhatia: yes, so, so about, to give you an idea of our entire portfolio, 40% would be about apm, about 7% to 8% would be nwg, another 25% would be, would be hpht. sabri hazarika: this is total atgl volumes, right? 1.8 million. rahul bhatia: that's right. sabri hazarika: and the remaining 28% would be in lng mix? rahul bhatia: that's correct. that's rlng. sabri hazarika: right. and, and this new well gas, do you expect it to increase or do you think the percentage will remain as it is? given the fact that it is new well gas, but in a way it's like, i mean, the overall production remains the same or probably it's declining only? rahul bhatia: so, we expect the new well gas to go up because, you know, for all of these fields, the producers now would be very encouraged that they are getting a little premium to apm gas. so, they will be encouraged to explore more and to ensure that these volumes would, you know, go up very significantly moving forward. sabri hazarika: and you mentioned about the review. so, the review will take place every month, right? rahul bhatia: no, it takes place once a quarter. page 8 of 12 Adani Total Gas Limited January 27, 2025"

    "Abhishek Pathak": "(14:26): Thank you, Hitesh. Good evening everyone. Let me take this opportunity to wish you all a wonderful new year, and season\u2019s greetings from all of us at JFSL. Q3 FY25 has been a quarter of robust operational execution, with a significant increase in our NBFC loan book and the launch of new products through the JioFinance app, our direct-to-customer digital distribution channel. In this context, we are pleased to share the financial highlights for the third quarter and nine months ended December 31, 2024. Our financial results for this period are prepared in compliance with Ind AS, as prescribed by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs. This slide highlights our group structure. JFSL is a holding company which operates its financial services businesses through its customer-facing subsidiaries, JVs and associates. With a prudent risk management framework and strong governance structures in place, these entities are supported by multi-layered products and business teams. During the quarter, Jio BlackRock Asset Management Private Limited was incorporated as a 50:50 JV, following JFSL and BlackRock receiving in-principle approval in September 2024 to sponsor a mutual fund. JFSL and BlackRock have made an initial investment of Rs. 82.5 crore each in this entity. Jio BlackRock Asset Management has filed for final approval with the regulator in December 2024. In addition, JFSL and BlackRock also made an initial investment of Rs. 3 crores each in Jio BlackRock Investment Advisers Private Limited, another 50:50 JV for wealth management, incorporated in September 2024. Moving on to the financial performance now. JFSL\u2019s consolidated total income for the quarter was Rs. 449 crore, versus Rs. 414 crore in Q3 FY24 and Rs. 694 crore in Q2 FY25. Sequentially, total income declined as total income in Q2 FY25 included a dividend of Rs. 241 crore received on the shares of Reliance Industries Limited, held by Reliance Industrial Investments and Holdings Limited, or RIIHL, which is an investment holding company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of JFSL. The consolidated total income for Q3 FY25 comprised the following: 1. Interest income of Rs. 210 crores, which includes interest earned on our loan book and income from our treasury operations. 2. Net gain on fair value changes on money market and liquid mutual funds of Rs. 191 crores and 3. Fees and commission income of Rs. 37 crores on account of fees received by the insurance broking and the payment services businesses With respect to our treasury operations, I would like to highlight that our prudent cash management helped us navigate a challenging market environment. The company\u2019s total expenses, including provisions, for Q3 FY25 was Rs. 131 crore, as compared to Rs. 98 crores in Q3 FY24 and Rs. 146 crores in Q2 FY25. Provisions, on account of ECL, increased to Rs 12 crores in Q3 FY25 from Rs 4 crores in Q2 FY25. Excluding provisions, total expenses declined on a quarterly basis. This was on account of annual CSR expense incurred in Q2 FY25; and pre-incorporation expenses attributable to new businesses in subsidiaries and JVs. Shares of Associates & Joint ventures stood at Rs. 59 crores in Q3 FY25 vs. Rs. 66 crore in Q3 FY24, and Rs. 225 crores in Q2 FY25. It may be noted that, in Q2 FY25, Reliance Services and Holdings Limited, or RSHL, received dividend on its investment in RIL shares. RSHL is accounted for as an associated of JFSL. Consolidated profit after tax in Q3 FY25 stood at Rs. 295 crores versus Rs. 294 crores in Q3 FY24 and Rs. 689 crores in Q2 FY25. On a\u2026 on a year-on-year basis, increase in total income was offset by higher expenses, including provisions, and lower share of associates and joint ventures. Now moving on to our standalone financial performance. Standalone total income in Q3 FY25 was Rs. 148 crore, versus Rs. 134 crores in Q3 FY24, and Rs. 383 crores in Q2 FY25. It is to be noted that in Q2 FY25, JFSL received dividend income of Rs. 235 crores from RIIHL. Total expenses, including provisions, for Q3 FY25, on a standalone basis, was Rs. 48 crore as compared to Rs. 36 crores in Q3 FY24 and Rs. 55 crores in Q2 FY25. The sequential decline in expenses was mainly due to CSR expense incurred in Q2 FY25 On a standalone basis, the profit after tax of the company for Q3 FY25 was Rs. 75 crore, vs Rs. 71 crores in Q3 FY24 and Rs. 305 crores in Q2 FY25. In conclusion, I would like to reiterate that we will continue to focus on our cost levers and aim to maintain best-in-class cost-to-income ratio, driving benefits for all our stakeholders. Thank you for your continued support as we pursue a sustainable path to value creation, within the guardrails of our four guiding principles. With this, I would like to hand over the call to Jill. Thank you so much for your time. Ms.",
    "Jill Deviprasad": "(21:29) Thank you, Hitesh and Abhishek. And thank you everyone, for joining this call. As we conclude our earnings call, we invite you to explore the detailed earnings presentation available on our website and the stock exchanges. Have a good one. Thank you."
