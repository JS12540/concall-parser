    dialogue:
    - dialogue: sir, in the -- as per the annual report, we manufactured close to
        59% of the products that we have sold last year. and this number increased
        from 49% in fy '23. now given that margins on the manufactured goods are higher
        than the private products, ideally the company-driven margins should have
        increased in fy '24, i think which was not the case. so could you elaborate
        something on that, please?
      speaker: Harshit Patel
    - dialogue: sure. so if you look at financial year '23, right, we were significantly
        impacted by the global inflation, right, which kind of started somewhere in
        2022 and kind of continue in the entire 2023 as well, right? so we took significant
        pricing actions in the market, right, where we were able to get better pricing
        from our customers in financial year '23 whereas in '24, the financial actions
        - - pricing actions have relatively stabilized, right? so our margins on the
        traded products were relatively much higher in financial year '23 vis-à- vis
        financial year '24, right? that's where when you look at even though our manufacturing
        mix went up to almost 60% in financial year '24, our overall margins for financial
        year '24 was relatively pretty much in line with what we experienced last
        year. hopefully that answers your question, right?
      speaker: Ashish Saraf
    - dialogue: yes, sir, that answers, sure. sir, secondly, on our railways portfolio,
        out of our overall railways and metro sales, how much is imported? and how
        much is manufactured by the sister unlisted company? i believe we wouldn't
        have been manufacturing anything in the listed entity for this particular
        segment?
      speaker: Harshit Patel
    - dialogue: for the railway segment, you are right. railways is almost -- a significant
        portion of it is already ruralized in india, but is manufactured by the unlisted
        company and is subsequently sold to skf india, which eventually move themselves
        into the end customer.
      speaker: Ashish Saraf
    - dialogue: sir, if you could broadly speak about the share between the imports
        vis-à-vis, the unlisted entity from where we source these railway products,
        then that will be...
      speaker: Harshit Patel
    - dialogue: the majority of it is sourced from the unlisted company, right? again,
        i don't have the exact number with me, but i would say almost 80% is sourced
        from the unlisted company, and the balance 20% is sourced from other skf companies.
      speaker: Ashish Saraf
    - dialogue: understood, sir. sir, just one clarification on the margins part.
        is the understanding correct that trading margins will always make certain
        positive ebitda on all the traded products, irrespective of whether manufacturing
        entity is making the loss or even very high profit. would that understanding
        be correct?
      speaker: Harshit Patel
    - dialogue: that is right. so for the traded products, skf india acts a limited
        risk distributor, right, where the margins for the -- for skf india is calculated
        under the transfer pricing guidelines, which is the net margin method, right,
        which ensures that skf india kind of makes reasonable margin on the products
        that it is selling, even though the actual margins might be way higher or
        we might be selling at a loss as well.
      speaker: Ashish Saraf
  Krupashankar:
    analyst_company: Avendus Spark
    dialogue:
    - dialogue: i have a few questions. first one, on your commentary in annual report
        stating back by fy '30, would like to double your revenues. i just wanted
        to get a sense that are we looking for any specific sectors beyond the traditional
        core sectors, which we have been operating in india? and like we have said
        with respect to exports and new opportunities coming up, is there any further
        avenues where this growth can be higher over the next 4 to 5 years? some comments
        on that.
      speaker: Krupashankar
    - dialogue: 'okay. so i think there are always segments where we will see higher
        growth. so -- and we''re continuing to look at those. so while i''ll just
        point out a couple of examples. one is from the automotive side, evs are faster
        growth. we have bearings, which are both hybrid and ceramic range, which are
        more suited and we have higher market share internationally also. so as the
        ev market grows, we expect to get more share and grow faster in those segments.
        that''s one. we already mentioned the high-speed trains. then there is also
        as india is investing more in things like semiconductors manufacturing and
        that will be part of our strategy up to 2030. we will -- we clearly have products
        which are much better suited for that manufacturing process also. again, we
        can get better market share and we expect higher growth there. even within
        our traditional segments, if you subsegment even we have a larger category
        of general machinery, if you look at -- within general machinery, if you look
        at machine tools, for example, that requires high-speed and low friction bearings.
        that is an area of strength for us. page 13 of 15 SKF India Limited

        August 14, 2024

        We will continue to look at that. So I''d say there''s multiple areas where
        we can do better and

        where we have a product which is superior.'
      speaker: Mukund Vasudevan
    - dialogue: understood. and on the export side of things also, if you can throw
        some light on whether there are opportunities beyond the korean transition,
        wherein indian ecosystem can be -- the manufacturing system can be much more
        suited for export opportunities.
      speaker: Krupashankar
    - dialogue: yes. so we're continuously looking at opportunities to export. we
        are -- i would say there's a substantial opportunity within the region itself,
        within the southeast asia, australia, there's opportunities there where we
        can export. we are already exporting, but we'll continue to expand that. the
        other americas, also we do export. but most of these we sell to our parent
        entity, whether it's americas or europe, we sell to our parent entity. and
        there, it's purely a -- in what way can we be the most competitive, that's
        the decision -- that's how the decision is made. so as we get more competitive,
        we hope that we can get more of that volume also, and we'll continue to work
        on that.
      speaker: Mukund Vasudevan
    - dialogue: one more thing on some of the initiatives, which skf has taken in
        the past, for example, there were long-term contracts wherein skf had entered
        with sale for supplying bearings with sensors and identifying measures. so
        i just wanted to get a sense as to what would be -- this has been -- this
        effort has been running for almost 4 to 5 years now. so just wanted to get
        a sense on what's the extent of contribution of specific such contracts? and
        has it helped in predominantly customer retention and in many cases, has that
        increased the wallet share per se?
      speaker: Krupashankar
    - dialogue: so there's many elements to services, right, and where you mentioned
        some of them like remote monitoring of our bearings, there is also what we
        -- that's what we call connected technologies. this is using iot devices to
        measure bearing noise, vibration, et cetera. we also have a reman, which is
        remanufacturing of bearings, which we do for railways and for some other heavy
        segments, which is basically using remanufacturing of bearing either refinishing
        it or replacing some portions of it so that it becomes more sustainable and
        it's more cost competitive, so -- but -- and extends life. so there are different
        elements. today, we are at around 5% to 6% of our business is services. we
        are looking to expand that because we are profitable, quite profitable, and
        we see more demand for it. as customers want more uptime or less downtime,
        and they want a full solution from the bearing manufacturer. it's something
        we're looking to do to continue to expand. specific to the example and sale,
        again, it's not something we share kind of share of wallet. but i would say
        every customer we get into, we are looking to kind of expand share of wallet.
        and where it makes -- where the customer is at gain from it. and we have delivered
        the value, which was expected. we do gain share.
      speaker: Mukund Vasudevan
    - dialogue: that's very helpful. last one, what would be the proportion of crb
        and srbs as a part of our total industrial mix, if at all, we can share a
        direction or approximate number?
      speaker: Krupashankar
    - dialogue: give us a second.
      speaker: Mukund Vasudevan
    - dialogue: 'so again crb data, i don''t have specifically, right? but crb is
        around 25% of the products... page 14 of 15 SKF India Limited

        August 14, 2024'
      speaker: Ashish Saraf
    - dialogue: okay. so the reason why i'm asking, sir, is that there is a sort of
        significant portion of new capacities you have coming on both from next year
        onwards. are you anticipating pricing pressure emerging because of dual capacity
        coming in the industry? or is -- we have a fair set of customer for probably
        a time frame of customer servicing due to which we can retain share? some
        thoughts on tax front as well.
      speaker: Krupashankar
    - dialogue: i didn't understand your question. is your question, are we adding
        capacity just to satisfy demand?
      speaker: Mukund Vasudevan
    - dialogue: what i was trying to highlight here is that one of your peers is adding
        large capacities on crb and srb, and that is likely to be commissioned in
        the next year. is it likely to drive pricing pressure in that particular category?
        and how is skf looking to mitigate this transition or change in overall industry
        capacity?
      speaker: Krupashankar
    - dialogue: i would say, look, we're also trying to localize as quickly as we
        can, both on crb and srbs. those are the 2 we mentioned or trbs, right? you
        mentioned.
      speaker: Mukund Vasudevan
    - dialogue: yes, crb and srb.
      speaker: Ashish Saraf
    - dialogue: srb -- crb and srb, yes.
      speaker: Krupashankar
    - dialogue: crb and srb, right. we are looking to localize more content there
        or more manufacturing there. i would say, there are strengths we have, there
        are strengths some of our competitors have. and we will continue to kind of
        evolve our product strategy to make ourselves not just more competitive, but
        to add more value to our customers. and i don't expect too much pricing pressure
        there, especially in areas of our strength. but i think it's -- like any other
        market it's a dynamic game, they -- competitors will make their moves, we
        will make our moves. and -- but i don't expect that there'll be a drastic
        pricing pressure just because of this.
      speaker: Mukund Vasudevan
    - dialogue: understood, sir. thank you and all the best. one humble request, please
        do continue engaging with investors on a continuous basis rather than once
        a year, that's my humble request.
      speaker: Krupashankar
    - dialogue: i think we are out of time, moderator?
      speaker: Mukund Vasudevan
  Mayank Bhandari:
    analyst_company: AMSEC
    dialogue:
    - dialogue: sir, my first question is on the annual report that you had recently
        published. couple of things you highlighted like you have 60% share in the
        vande bharat train set and 100% share of business in the drive systems and
        90% ballroom -- 90% for roll ball bearings. just wanted to understand, have
        you already won those orders or you are yet to execute or you already executed
        these orders? because – and the reason i'm asking is because in railways,
        your business seems to have declined and there seems to be good commentary
        in the annual report around the business?
      speaker: Mayank Bhandari
    - dialogue: so on the railway business, if you look at [train] 18, again, as we
        mentioned in the annual report, we kind of continue to have a good share of
        business and we continue to win orders in the in the train 18 business. overall
        railway business, where you see a competition in growth is whereas we are
        not growing freight business, right, which is where relatively our share is
        much lower compared to our competition, given the overall pricing pressures
        that we see in the overall trade.
      speaker: Ashish Saraf
    - dialogue: yes, we executed the vande bharat.
      speaker: Mukund Vasudevan
    - dialogue: yes, the vande bharat seems to be -- as already -- as i said, we already
        continue to have 50% share, and we continue to win orders from...
      speaker: Ashish Saraf
    - dialogue: some of it has been executed. so what you're seeing there is a mix
        of what we have won, but what we have walked away from in freight.
      speaker: Mukund Vasudevan
    - dialogue: okay. and in the freight, you last time had mentioned that you had
        a double-digit market share. so how we see the market share now in the freight
        as you are telling that we are not being able to ramp up in the freight?
      speaker: Mayank Bhandari
    - dialogue: so i don't think we have published that level of detail. but if you
        send a question separately, we can look at it. we can see what we can share
        with you.
      speaker: Mukund Vasudevan
    - dialogue: 'okay. okay. and secondly, you had also mentioned that in the annual
        report capacity utilization for fy ''24 was around 84% and with the kind of
        number you have given of inr16 crores bearings almost in fy ''24. this number
        is it on the volume side? so i''m just wondering if you page 11 of 15 SKF
        India Limited

        August 14, 2024

        can give the breakdown of value versus volume growth in FY ''24, we think
        that total number is

        6% growth in FY ''24.'
      speaker: Mayank Bhandari
    - dialogue: so your question is in terms of sales volume...
      speaker: Ashish Saraf
    - dialogue: volume growth versus...
      speaker: Mukund Vasudevan
    - dialogue: as i said the manufacturing, this is again correlated to the overall
        manufacturing mix, right? my manufacturing mix for financial year '24 -- so
        60% of my total net sales came in from all the bearings that we manufacture.
      speaker: Ashish Saraf
    - dialogue: no, actually, i was trying to understand 6% growth of fy '24, what
        would be the volume growth and value growth breakup?
      speaker: Mayank Bhandari
    - dialogue: i wouldn't have that number in terms of what would be the volume growth
        for the manufacturing products. we can come back to that...
      speaker: Ashish Saraf
    - dialogue: okay. and just lastly, sir, in the annual report you mentioned that
        indian ball bearing industry is expected to grow at almost 11% cagr, '23 to
        '29. and global market is expected to grow at almost 4%. our growth has been
        bit sluggish in the domestic market, where industry itself, we are forecasting
        to grow at double digit and we are growing in single digits. what is our road
        map of improving this growth in the domestic market?
      speaker: Mayank Bhandari
    - dialogue: 'so i think globally, because of a lot of headwinds -- so i''ll answer
        your first part first, right, globally, because of a lot of headwinds, we
        are not seeing that kind of growth, which was projected. the china economy
        is down, that itself is bringing down growth. emea is -- or europe, middle
        east, africa is also down. europe is also down significantly because of war
        and, to some extent, middle east unrest is also causing a downturn. and then
        americas is also a little bit of -- i mean it''s not yet into recession, but
        it''s -- the economy is quite soft. it''s not -- it''s in very low single-digit
        growth right now. so i would say the previous statement of overall bearing
        growth of 4% globally is probably not quite what we are seeing. as far as
        india is concerned, i would say our strategy has always been profitable growth.
        we will continue to aspire to grow at 11% plus, right, but not at the expense
        of profitability. and what you''re seeing -- what you''re calling softness
        right now is kind of very prudent actions on our part on what to pursue and
        what not to pursue. in terms of future, how we kind of want to get back to
        higher growth numbers, i think it''s a strategy of what we have spoken about
        in the past. it''s -- more localization will help us get more competitive.
        it''s about going after the segments where we see growth. so very focused
        strategies around these high-growth segments. developing products for these
        high-growth segments like innovating with oems, whether it''s automotive or
        industrial oems to deliver against -- to gain additional market share and
        continue to expand our overall solution to the customer, including services
        and associated bearing products with bearings. so all those are elements of
        our growth strategy. we continue to drive each one of these, both with our
        internal teams, but also with our channel partners, distributors. page 12
        of 15 SKF India Limited

        August 14, 2024'
      speaker: Mukund Vasudevan
    - dialogue: so basically what you're saying that we are trying but to retain the
        market share, but it seems that the counter feed products or the unorganized
        sector seems to be growing faster in the ball bearing segment than the organized
        sector? or is it the correct way to understand?
      speaker: Mayank Bhandari
    - dialogue: i don't think the data is that clear on that. but our -- i would say
        this is an anecdotal or information, which we are hearing in the -- hearing
        through talking to various customers. there is some uptake in, i would not
        say fake bearings, but in terms of unbranded -- or unbranded bearings, but
        that is something we continue to watch out for. and i don't think it will
        be a big needle mover. some segments in the market may go for either fake
        or unbranded, but we continue to watch those and see what we can do to kind
        of recover those customers or eliminate the fakes -- the source of the fakes.
      speaker: Mukund Vasudevan
    - dialogue: okay. and sir, lastly, you also mentioned that the renewable energy
        seems to be -- i mean, you're kind of integrating it into your factories,
        wind, solar and all, you're doing capex in the pune factory for renewable
        energy. so is there any number you can give us in terms of what will be the
        cost savings going forward in terms of once the projects are completely executed.
      speaker: Mayank Bhandari
    - dialogue: so i'd say the first step is just around sustainability. i think today,
        we are at around 45% is of what we -- energy we use is renewable. we're continuing
        to move that needle. that number has gone up by almost 10 percentage points
        over last year. so we continue to move that needle. in terms of cost savings,
        we'll have to come back to you with the exact numbers with how much cost savings
        we have seen so far, right. we'll come back to you with the numbers if you
        send us an e-mail.
      speaker: Mukund Vasudevan
  Mukesh Saraf:
    analyst_company: Avendus Spark
    dialogue:
    - dialogue: my first question is on the revenue mix. so could you kind of give
        us some details on the different segments like the auto, industrial, exports
        and probably within that, some of the subsegments as well.
      speaker: Mukesh Saraf
    - dialogue: all right. i'll let ashish saraf, my cfo, answer that in terms of
        so that he can share precise numbers.
      speaker: Mukund Vasudevan
    - dialogue: sure. so if you look at this quarter's revenue, right, we reported
        net sales of around inr11.8 billion, right, all of which around 50% was industrial
        business and around 41% was automotive, and the balance 8% to 9% was exports.
        so that's the overall split. in terms of key segments, which delivered growth
        in this quarter, the key segments which delivered strong growth within heavy
        industries and metals within the industrial business and 2-wheelers, cars
        and tractor business within the automotive business.
      speaker: Ashish Saraf
    - dialogue: 'so would you be able to kind of provide some breakup, like, say,
        within auto, how much is 2- wheelers, 4-wheelers and say, within industrial,
        how much is the heavy industrials, metals, wind, rail, some of these key end
        markets? page 2 of 15 SKF India Limited

        August 14, 2024'
      speaker: Mukesh Saraf
    - dialogue: sure. so 2-wheelers, out of the total 100%, right? i'm giving you
        the share of the -- so 2-wheeler is around 13% of our business. and heavy
        is around 5%. overall aftermarket, both industrial and automotive is around
        35%.
      speaker: Ashish Saraf
    - dialogue: how much would rail and wind be, sir?
      speaker: Mukesh Saraf
    - dialogue: yes. so rail is around 7% and wind is around 3% of the overall business.
      speaker: Ashish Saraf
    - dialogue: you said 3%?
      speaker: Mukesh Saraf
    - dialogue: yes. that's right.
      speaker: Ashish Saraf
    - dialogue: okay. sir, and 4 wheelers, say, within autos, like 2-wheeler you mentioned
        is 13%, 4-wheeler should be, i mean passenger cars?
      speaker: Mukesh Saraf
    - dialogue: 4-wheeler is around 6% of our overall business. when i say 4-wheelers,
        again, i'm talking about passenger cars only.
      speaker: Ashish Saraf
    - dialogue: right. understood great. and the second question is on your localization
        strategy. i mean, we do understand that i think you should be around 60% localized
        in skf india in terms of manufacturing in india itself. so what's the strategy
        there in terms of trying to localize or substitute some of the imports, especially
        in the industrial segment. so this -- i want to also kind of juxtapose with
        the fact that the parent company in its recent commentary mentioned that they're
        going to be cutting back on capex globally. so how are they -- how is the
        parent company looking at the indian operations with respect to adding more
        capacity locally here and probably even at some point in time looking to export
        from here or rather increasing export from here.
      speaker: Mukesh Saraf
    - dialogue: okay. i can take that question. so you're right, we are around 60%
        localized. the automotive side of the business is a lot more localized. so
        it's almost 95% localized, and the industrial is a little less. so the main
        focus of localization is on the industrial business. and our aspiration there
        is to kind of take around 40%, 45% right now to 65% in the next 2 to 3 years.
        so that process of localization has already started. it is in -- will continue.
        the global strategy on reducing capex is just prudent, but it doesn't mean
        the same brush applies to all regions, where it makes sense, both for -- to
        build competitive value chains, which is one of the stated strategies of even
        the parent company where it makes sense for local region for region growth,
        we are making investments, but we're just being prudent about it.
      speaker: Mukund Vasudevan
    - dialogue: sir, just one clarification there, when you mentioned localization
        here, do you talk only about this listed company, skf india? or do you talk
        about the other sister company here as well in india?
      speaker: Mukesh Saraf
    - dialogue: so my answers right now are mainly around the listed company, right?
        so...

        to mukund sir on your new role. sir, just first on broader level, how are
        you seeing the demand side, particularly on auto replacement and on the industrial
        sides, whether railways will drives -- whether the demand augurs more bullish.
        can you indicate how the demand trends are there, sir?
      speaker: Mumuksh Mandlesha
    - dialogue: so i can answer that. it's -- so let's start with the automotive side.
        overall, i think automotive is a mixed bag, while the 2-wheeler and tractor
        segment is continuing to see some growth, especially 2-wheelers. the passenger
        vehicle and commercial vehicle has been relatively flat. passenger vehicles,
        inside passenger vehicles, we are seeing a little bit of a shift towards larger
        vehicles, suvs kind of things. of course, though the volume is small, evs
        is both in 2-wheelers and 4-wheelers is growing a bit -- is growing faster.
        so i'd say, demand-wise, mixed bag in automotive. industrial, we are seeing
        all the infrastructure-led segment growing well, which are heavy metals, heavy
        being cement and a few others, metals and correspondingly aftermarket also,
        right? we are seeing decent demand from wind and railways, but we are trading
        very cautiously there mainly to preserve our margins because i expect -- price
        expectations there are quite low. so broadly, that's kind of where we see.
        but we are very diversified, as ashish mentioned in terms of our split of
        segments. so we're able to play the economic cycles much better.
      speaker: Mukund Vasudevan
    - dialogue: got it, sir. so i mean just on the wind and railway, just can you
        explain me more what kind of price challenge is there in this market with
        railways, sir?
      speaker: Mumuksh Mandlesha
    - dialogue: i think it's driven by -- in wind, the pricing of -- it starts with
        the end-to-end user pricing, which has been low. so since these are all driven
        by end user price options, reverse options. so we -- that trickles down to
        the oems who are supplying equipment to the epcs who are building the wind
        farms. so the price pressure start from the -- all the way from the auction
        of setting up wind farms, all the way back to us as equipment -- as component
        suppliers to equipment to manufacturers. so that's the reason for the price
        pressures there. it's just very, very competitive, both for the oem and for
        us. so we selectively play there. we pick even within -- there's multiple
        bearings which go within a windmill, and we pick the ones where we clearly
        have an edge when we can get the price expectations of product -- a better
        product demand. on railways, it -- again, it varies. we have fairly high share
        in some of the high-speed trains, which are being introduced like vande bharat
        and things like that, metros. on freight, it is a lot more competitive, and
        that goes largely with l1 auctions as is norm normally in any government projects.
        and there, we are facing increasing price pressures.
      speaker: Mukund Vasudevan
    - dialogue: got it, sir. so would the segment would still be in positive growth
        side sir, railways and wind, sir?
      speaker: Mumuksh Mandlesha
    - dialogue: for us? or are you saying overall?
      speaker: Mukund Vasudevan
    - dialogue: 'for you, sir? page 5 of 15 SKF India Limited

        August 14, 2024'
      speaker: Mumuksh Mandlesha
    - dialogue: for us, i would say wind on the top line is actually down, and it's
        primarily because of conscious actions to back away from some projects. railways
        is a little lumpy, but i don't know the exact growth in railways.
      speaker: Mukund Vasudevan
    - dialogue: so just to add to what mukund said, for wind business, we had taken
        customer pruning actions, but mostly customer pruning actions for the wind
        business are completed, right, as we kind of close off q2. so we kind of expect
        going forward that the wind business should start growing again. with respect
        to railways and defense business, again, because of elections, relatively,
        the growth in this quarter was flat, but we expect our railway business to
        grow a bit. as mukund said, it's a lumpy business. it's a tender business.
        so as nda as kind of formed the government, again, we expect their policies
        with respect to transforming railways will continue in some of the flagship
        projects like train 18 and others, freight corridor and all will continue
        to expand. and with that, we should be able to expand as well and see growth
        in the upcoming quarters.
      speaker: Ashish Saraf
    - dialogue: got it, sir. and sir, in l1, what kind of guidance would you give,
        sir, with auto industry, sir? will it be closer to double digits, sir, which
        we have shown in the past, sir?
      speaker: Mumuksh Mandlesha
    - dialogue: so generally, as a practice, we do not provide any guidance or --
        to the market. so we kind of leave it at that?
      speaker: Ashish Saraf
    - dialogue: got it, sir. so sir, broadly, i mean, i was seeing some of the peers
        on the bid bearing side, they were doing very good double-digit growth. and
        we had -- i mean we also had a good growth in q4 quarter, but in q1, we saw
        a smaller growth. so is it more related alerted to the wind in railways where
        we have moved selectively going for the orders, sir?
      speaker: Mumuksh Mandlesha
    - dialogue: that would be right.
      speaker: Mukund Vasudevan
    - dialogue: got it, sir. sir, just on the previous quarter of q2 fy '24 where
        we had a sudden dip in the margins and then we saw the recovery in the latest
        quarters. just can you speak about what happened in the quarter sir?
      speaker: Mumuksh Mandlesha
    - dialogue: sorry, i didn't understand the question. can you repeat again?
      speaker: Mukund Vasudevan
    - dialogue: yes. so on the q2 fy '24 quarter, sir, the last year quarter, sir,
        there was sudden dip in the margins, almost like 500, 600 bps fall in the
        margins sir, which, i mean, got recovered in the corresponding quarters. i
        just want to understand what happened particularly in that quarter, sir?
      speaker: Mumuksh Mandlesha
    - dialogue: so if i have understood your question clearly, you are asking that
        in this quarter, we had a slight drop in our margins compared to last quarter.
      speaker: Ashish Saraf
    - dialogue: no, no. he is saying q2 fy '24, there was a dip and what was the dip
        due to and since then, we have recovered.
      speaker: Mukund Vasudevan
    - dialogue: 'so if you look at our -- again, i don''t recollect exactly like this
        2 quarters away. but if i look at my q4 results for last year, right? relatively,
        my sales for q4, right, was -- you''re talking about q4 ''24, this is jan
        to march. page 6 of 15 SKF India Limited

        August 14, 2024'
      speaker: Ashish Saraf
    - dialogue: q2 fy '24, sir.
      speaker: Mumuksh Mandlesha
    - dialogue: q2 fy '24, which is july to september quarter.
      speaker: Ashish Saraf
    - dialogue: yes.
      speaker: Mumuksh Mandlesha
    - dialogue: okay. so again, if you look at that quarter, year-on-year, there was
        relatively a dip in our overall sales, right? we didn't grow our business
        because we had some impacts coming in from the distribution business as well
        as we had some challenges in the automotive business as well, right? so that
        kind of impacted our results because there was not a significant growth in
        that particular quarter. that's what i recollect, that kind of had an adverse
        effect.
      speaker: Ashish Saraf
    - dialogue: was any impact of any trading mix particularly going up very high
        in that quarter or imports been higher?
      speaker: Mumuksh Mandlesha
    - dialogue: asking specifically july to september and this is -- this earnings
        call is specifically for this quarter. what i would recommend is that if you
        have any specific questions to any of the previous quarters, if you can just
        send us an e-mail and i can revert back to you on that. i think that would
        be...
      speaker: Ashish Saraf
    - dialogue: sure. sir, can you share what was the trading mix for this quarter
        and for the previous quarter q4 and q1 quarter, last year?
      speaker: Mumuksh Mandlesha
    - dialogue: what was the trading mix, right? so this quarter, we had a good improvement
        in our manufacturing mix. our manufacturing mix was around 64%, whereas traded
        product sale was 36%. so we are seeing improvements in our manufacturing mix
        if you compare year on...
      speaker: Ashish Saraf
    - dialogue: okay. sir, also, can you share -- you shared for the q1, the segmental
        mix. can you share also for the fy '24 for our calculation purpose?
      speaker: Mumuksh Mandlesha
    - dialogue: so if you look at financial year 24, our industrial mix was again
        -- industrial was at 51%. automotive was around 40%. and again, exports was
        at around 8%, right? so again, some of the key segments within the industrial
        business, distribution was almost 50%, which is 25% of the overall business.
        and segments like general machinery was at 8%, rail and defense was at 7%
        and heavy industries was at 5%. similarly, in the 2-wheeler business, again,
        the after -- 2-wheeler -- sorry, in the automotive business, the aftermarket
        business was around 11%. and cars business was at around 5%, 2-wheeler was
        at 13% and trucks and tractors were at around 6%. so pretty much similar mix
        as to what you see for full year last year versus what you see in this quarter.
      speaker: Ashish Saraf
    - dialogue: and sir, on the drive and power train, what would be the mix, sir?
      speaker: Mumuksh Mandlesha
    - dialogue: yes. so drives and power train was around 6%.
      speaker: Ashish Saraf
    - dialogue: 'sir, on the capex guidance, for fy ''25, what would be the guidance?
        page 7 of 15 SKF India Limited

        August 14, 2024'
      speaker: Mumuksh Mandlesha
    - dialogue: so if you look at our financial year '24, we have increased our capex
        kind of spend around inr140 crores on capex. and for financial year '25 as
        well, we expect our capex to more or less remain in a similar way.
      speaker: Ashish Saraf
    - dialogue: and, sir, out of which you said inr30 crores is a maintenance capex,
        rest would be for the growth capex, sir?
      speaker: Mumuksh Mandlesha
    - dialogue: yes, you are right. and then there are new investments on channels
        and things like that as well.
      speaker: Ashish Saraf
    - dialogue: okay. i mean generally, where the capacity is seeing the increase
        -- which segments you're seeing the increase in capacity?
      speaker: Mumuksh Mandlesha
    - dialogue: i think it's pretty much across the board where we are -- i mean we're
        seeing it in automotive. we are seeing it in some of the industrial areas.
        we spoke about some of the areas like -- so i'd say a lot of the investment
        is going to -- some on pure because we are running out of capacity in the
        automotive side. some of it is for new areas of expansion, especially in the
        aftermarket of industrial -- which is a widespread, everything from general
        machinery to some of the heavy industries.
      speaker: Mukund Vasudevan
    - dialogue: so when you say aftermarket expansion, it is more related to warehousing
        and those areas, sir?
      speaker: Mumuksh Mandlesha
    - dialogue: no. the bearing we manufacture goes into the aftermarket, meaning
        goes through distribution into a wide area of end users.
      speaker: Mukund Vasudevan
  Raj Shah:
    analyst_company: Marcellus
    dialogue:
    - dialogue: first of all, i would like to thank you the management for this call,
        and i hope that this a regular practice. so my first question is actually
        a follow-up of the previous participant's question regarding this south korea
        specialty being closed down and the transfer of those products to the india
        and china facility. so the question was, has this already started from this
        year? or do you anticipate going forward this will happen?
      speaker: Raj Shah
    - dialogue: it has already started in a sense that we have already started the
        transition process, but the transition is not yet fully completed, it is in
        process, right?
      speaker: Ashish Saraf
    - dialogue: got it. another question was, see, i mean, as you mentioned that the
        manufacturing mix has increased, i'm talking from f '24 perspective. so if
        i see there is a fall in the traded goods being sold number and there is an
        increase in, say, our industrial revenues. so is there any specific, if you
        can mention increase in the industrial localization content for the year fy
        '24?
      speaker: Raj Shah
    - dialogue: 'i will not have specific data with respect to what is the local content
        increase for the manufacturing products -- for the industrial products. but
        overall, just kind of looking at what is my manufacturing mix and trading
        mix. so that has gone up, right. for financial year ''24, it''s page 10 of
        15 SKF India Limited

        August 14, 2024

        at 60% overall manufacturing mix vis-a-vis last year of 55%. Specific to industrial,
        maybe you

        can send me a question, and I can get back to you.'
      speaker: Ashish Saraf
    - dialogue: last question was in the industrial demand. so sir, we are hearing
        a lot of companies doing excessive steel and cement sector. i just wanted
        to know your thoughts from the demand perspective in this other industries.
      speaker: Raj Shah
    - dialogue: yes. i think the demand is strong, and we are also doing very well
        there, right? we're seeing almost 30% odd growth in the heavy metals section,
        which is driven by the infrastructure. so when we continue seeing that while
        a temporary blip might be there in terms of the elections, might have been
        there in the last quarter, i think we continue to see that continuing through
        to the next year.
      speaker: Mukund Vasudevan
  Rajkumar Vaidyanathan:
    analyst_company: Individual Investor
    dialogue:
    - dialogue: sir, i have one clarification and 2 questions. the first clarification
        is you mentioned that the sales growth for the current quarter is tepid due
        to lower contribution from rail segment, and you expect this segment to pick
        up in the subsequent quarter. so is that understanding correct, sir?
      speaker: Rajkumar Vaidyanathan
    - dialogue: not quite, right? rail is one of the contributors, but there is also
        a little bit on the wind, which is due to customer pruning from last year.
        so that's part of the reason. so wind was a contributor also. without the
        wind customer pruning, there would have been at least a 2.5% to 3% uptick
        in our growth. also, there was some slowdown due to elections in the aftermarket
        and distribution and in some of the investments being made by the heavy industry.
        so i would say combination of this is the reason for slightly lower growth,
        but we're not worried.
      speaker: Mukund Vasudevan
    - dialogue: okay. so you expect the growth to pick up in the coming quarters,
        right?
      speaker: Rajkumar Vaidyanathan
    - dialogue: yes. that's our expectation.
      speaker: Mukund Vasudevan
    - dialogue: yes. so the first question is just labeling on the previous point,
        pardon me, the previous questioner. so you mentioned that the localization
        is about approximately 60%. but if i see your income statement, the ratio
        of the cost from a value standpoint or the cost of material consumed vis-a-vis
        their stocking trade, if you see -- basically it is 40 versus 60. so i just
        want to know when these 2 will also converge to the percentages that we are
        talking about?
      speaker: Rajkumar Vaidyanathan
    - dialogue: 'so again, can you repeat because i can''t hear you very clearly.
        page 8 of 15 SKF India Limited

        August 14, 2024'
      speaker: Ashish Saraf
    - dialogue: i'm not sure the 2 are connected. i think the question was our localized
        content is around 60%, but our mix between stock and sales versus make to
        order, right, is more like stock and sell is more like 30%. is that what you
        said?
      speaker: Mukund Vasudevan
    - dialogue: 40%. if you see this material consumed is inr302 crores and particularly
        the stocking trade is about inr495 crores. or if you just take fy '23-'24,
        that's more appropriate, inr1,160 crores on material consumed vis-a-vis inr1,632
        crores on stocking trade. so that's about 40% 60%. so i just -- my question
        is when, from a value standpoint, also this will converge from whatever percentages
        that you mentioned?
      speaker: Rajkumar Vaidyanathan
    - dialogue: i get your question now. so in a stable environment, yes, right, that
        this -- the spend on raw material and the spend on finished goods, right,
        should more or less align to the overall manufacturing mix and towards trading
        -- and the trading mix. however, we are not operating in a perfect world,
        right? the costs in european factories or factories in the developed markets
        are relatively higher, right? so cost of procuring those products and selling
        in the indian market will be relatively much higher. and the products which
        we are manufacturing or we have localized in the indian market, considering
        that if your supplier -- if your sourcing is from the indian market, it's
        relatively much more stable. so you will always see a bit of gap between the
        actual mix of manufacturing and trading versus the actual cost associated
        with the manufactured products and then the traded products.
      speaker: Ashish Saraf
    - dialogue: you're right. theoretically, you're right, it should start converging
        as we localize more. it will never converge fully because we will always trade
        some products. it doesn't -- we don't have economies of scale to manufacture
        everything here locally. but as we localize more, this will converge more
        and more.
      speaker: Mukund Vasudevan
    - dialogue: okay. got it, sir. sir, the second question is, i mean, just an extension
        of the first question only. so i just wonder if your margins -- manufacturing
        margins higher than your trading margins or it's the other way. i don't want
        the exact number just from a relationship...
      speaker: Rajkumar Vaidyanathan
    - dialogue: the manufacturing margins are higher than our trading margins, that's
        right.
      speaker: Ashish Saraf
    - dialogue: okay. and just to label on the same point, if i compare your material
        cost from q4 of fy '23- '24 vis-a-vis the current q1, it has moved from 58.75
        to almost 60 points. there's a 200 bps increase in material cost. so i just
        thought with the softness in steel and other commodities, we should have seen
        a better kind of...
      speaker: Rajkumar Vaidyanathan
    - dialogue: the costs have increased because our overall production has increased.
        our manufacturing mix has gone up, right, from 58% quarter-over-quarter to
        64%, right? so if you look at my overall mix has gone up by 6%, whereas the
        cost has gone up, as you said, by a couple of percentage points.
      speaker: Ashish Saraf
    - dialogue: 'okay. got it. sir, the second question is, see, in the last quarter,
        there was a question asked about the transition of some business from korea
        to india because your parent company has mentioned page 9 of 15 SKF India
        Limited

        August 14, 2024

        that they are going to shut down some plants in Korea and Germany and some
        of the business

        will move to plants in India, China and Mexico. So just wanted to know any
        color on that...'
      speaker: Rajkumar Vaidyanathan
    - dialogue: yes, you are right. there is a transition like there are some channels
        which are moving from korea to india, which is registered, that's right.
      speaker: Ashish Saraf
    - dialogue: so any idea what is the value of those -- in terms of value, how much
        -- when will the...
      speaker: Rajkumar Vaidyanathan
    - dialogue: i don't have the values with me right now, but it's already baked
        in on our capex spend kind of communicated for the like -- in the previous
        question.
      speaker: Ashish Saraf
    - dialogue: okay. and lastly, sir, what are the margin levers that are available
        to the company to go forward?
      speaker: Rajkumar Vaidyanathan
    - dialogue: so i think we have mentioned this before, obviously, localization
        is clearly one, which will improve -- continue to improve our margin. we continue
        to look at pricing where we believe our products justify a premium. there
        is pricing action being taken. portfolio cleanup, where if there is unprofitable
        or low profitable customer, we either negotiate price increases with them
        or we drop it. we're not chasing growth for the sake of growth, we are chasing
        profitable growth. and last but not the least, continuous improvement in our
        manufacturing and procurement. all these are in place. and i think we'll continue
        to support our -- on margin improvement.
      speaker: Mukund Vasudevan
    - dialogue: okay. so is it fair to say then going forward, the margin play will
        be more -- much better than your top line play?
      speaker: Rajkumar Vaidyanathan
    - dialogue: i don't think there is -- it's one or the other. i would say we have
        taken some of those tough pricing and customer portfolio cleanup actions.
        i would expect a little more focus on the top line and -- but maintaining
        or slightly improving margins.
      speaker: Mukund Vasudevan
