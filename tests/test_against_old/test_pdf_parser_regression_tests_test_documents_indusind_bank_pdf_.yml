    dialogue:
    - dialogue: i have two questions, one for mr. j sridharan to clarify and one to
        mr. sriram. on mfi, for the bfil plus 3 customers, existing customers, are
        you giving repeat loans for the moment? or are they also not getting repeat
        loans? and in the quarter, out of the inr1,700-odd crores provisions, how
        much provision have you made for mfi? is it around inr550 crores, give or
        take? back to the question on vehicles.
      speaker: Abhishek Murarka
    - dialogue: as far as the number of lenders are concerned, as of now, we give
        loans only on a very selective customers. so an existing customer having three
        other lenders, if there is an ability, because if you know our overall limit
        is the lowest in the industry. we still do not lend more than 1.25 lakh net
        industry exposure. so we are very selective in lending and the proportion
        of loans going to good customers in that segment also is low. once the mfi
        regulations come, obviously, we will not be lending to that customer. the
        entire industry will move to lender plus 2 norm.
      speaker: J Sridharan
    - dialogue: okay. but as of now, they are getting, if they're a good customer,
        they are getting a repeat loan.
      speaker: Abhishek Murarka
    - dialogue: they are because that is part of the program. we have not stopped,
        but that's a very small number, not a substantial or significant number.
      speaker: J Sridharan
    - dialogue: in terms of provisioning, we don't share business-wise provisions.
        so we have given you slippages. different businesses have their own provision
        coverage ratios, which we try to maintain. bank as a whole, you would have
        seen, we have maintained 70% pcr. business unit level net npa as well as provisions
        we don't share.
      speaker: Indrajit Yadav
    - dialogue: 'okay. no worries. and on vehicles, 4q is generally quite strong for
        disbursement as well as for recovery, etcetera. so asset quality. do you see
        that kind of trend or this inr13,000-odd crores of disbursement in the quarter,
        that was just a bit of an aberration? and the segment is still going through
        a bit of consolidation. so it will come down. so just some commentary on growth
        and asset quality in the next maybe 3 to 6 months there would help. a. g.
        sriram: q3 was good. the growth rate of vehicles, if you see the retail growth
        rate has been in single digits, except for 2-wheelers. so not much is expected
        to change in the q4 also, it should be in the similar lines. and commercial
        vehicle is expected to grow in sync with the gdp. unless gdp grows over 6%,
        there may not be much of growth in commercial vehicle segment. gone are those
        days when sales in commercial vehicle was the trendsetter. now more or less
        people like to buy with the work order only. so as and when gdp increases,
        there will be growth in commercial vehicle sector. so more or less, we are
        expecting for a similar disbursements numbers in q3 around rs.13,500 crores.'
      speaker: Abhishek Murarka
    - dialogue: 'and asset quality there? a. g. sriram: again, q4 is one of the best
        quarters. so we are keeping our fingers crossed.'
      speaker: Abhishek Murarka
    - dialogue: done. a very quick question on mfi how is the disbursement trending?
        like given that forward flows have improved the data that you shared, is disbursement
        going to pick up? and versus q3, is it going to be higher? or maybe jan, what's
        the run rate, some indication there would help.
      speaker: Abhishek Murarka
    - dialogue: 'we want to be cautious about the disbursements. we continue to remain
        a watchful of the trends. i think what is more important is to focus on your
        good customers and good centers and that is where 85% to 88% of our disbursement
        should be targeted. that''s our philosophy. we are not looking at any disbursement
        number. what is important is to make sure that we service our customers well.
        and we are in the in centers which are performing well and do the disbursements
        there. page 12 of 16 IndusInd Bank Limited

      speaker: Sumant Kathpalia
    - dialogue: right. but sumant, just qoq, it should improve, right, given that
        there is an improvement in the 0 dpd bucket, etcetera?
      speaker: Abhishek Murarka
    - dialogue: yes, it should, but i don't want to give any number as of now. because
        i want to continue to watch this space, how the karnataka develops, how does
        it pass on to another state, how does up behave? so i don't want to give any
        numbers or projection of the mfi business as of now.
      speaker: Sumant Kathpalia
  Anand Dama:
    analyst_company: Emkay Global
    dialogue:
    - dialogue: sir, what explains the higher slippages in the tractor, small cv segment?
        and also, if you can provide the mfi exposure in the state of karnataka, where
        there are basically new rules coming up? and do you see any impact of that
        on your portfolio?
      speaker: Anand Dama
    - dialogue: 'okay. so let sriram answer the tractor as well as the scv. a. g.
        sriram: in tractors the 60 to 360 bucket has inched up. so a year back itself,
        we have made our underwriting norms stricter. but whatever flowed into 60
        to 360 slowly has been flowing into npa. so that is what we are seeing. with
        the tighter underwriting norms, after 3-4 months, the slippages should slow
        down. the next 3-4 months, there will be increased slippage in tractors from
        existing dpd buckets. having said that, the higher yield in this segment should
        help in compensating the increase in credit cost this segment also help us
        in achieving the priority sector targets. and on small commercial vehicle,
        yes, again, high yield makes the risk adjusted return favourable. slippages
        generally come down in q4. so we are expecting slippages to be arrested in
        this q4 itself.'
      speaker: Sumant Kathpalia
    - dialogue: on the karnataka, we have 13% of our micro finance book in karnataka
        and 1% of total book is in impacted districts. we have degrown this book in
        karnataka by about 4% qoq.
      speaker: Sumant Kathpalia
    - dialogue: but do you see any early signs of stress building over there because
        of this new laws coming in?
      speaker: Anand Dama
    - dialogue: i think the collection efficiency in the karnataka is down by 1%.
        that's the early stress.
      speaker: Sumant Kathpalia
    - dialogue: okay. do you see that coming down further with the law coming up and
        collections been restricted?
      speaker: Anand Dama
    - dialogue: the law we are talking about, we are not very sure we don't have fair
        visibility. as far as the latest discussion with the government is concerned,
        the government says that wherever there are regulated entities, the regulations
        will take care, they will not have any law impacting them. they will come
        very heavily on the unregulated entities. the proposed law may impose certain
        conditions on outsourcing collection activity or in ensuring that the customer
        protection standards are fully met, which are already part of the regulations.
        so we are still not sure what are the new regulation ordinance law that is
        being talked about. we are watching the space. initially, there is some amount
        of discomfort. now i think things are slightly settling down in terms of the
        legislation or the ordinance front, but the space is to be watched. as far
        as the stress is concerned, i think it's in a manageable space, maybe a 100
        basis point reduction in the collection efficiency in a few pockets. i think
        it's manageable.
      speaker: J Sridharan
    - dialogue: sure. and lastly, any outlook on the gems and jewelry portfolio? are
        you seeing any early signs of stress over there?
      speaker: Anand Dama
    - dialogue: so we don't have any sma 1, 2 or restructured account on the gems
        and jewelry portfolio. our book has not grown. you are aware of it. we do
        working capital finance and we've not seen any stress building up in this
        book.
      speaker: Sumant Kathpalia
  Chintan Joshi:
    analyst_company: Autonomous
    dialogue:
    - dialogue: just follow up on that nim point from earlier. i appreciate you don't
        want to guide us on what might happen in the near term. but how should i think
        about kind of nim evolution, say, 12, 18 months down the line once we are
        past this mfi stress period. how big is mfi now going to be part of the loan
        book? and also what kind of margin should we expect once that kind of stabilizes
        at the level that you want now that we kind of appreciate more that mfi will
        remain cyclical. i wonder if you're thinking it may go back to 12% of the
        loan book down the line or not. and related to that, i would like to understand
        through the cycle, how do you see the roa on the mfi business? we go through
        external shocks in this book every few years. so just trying to understand
        how you think about through-the-cycle roas in this business?
      speaker: Chintan Joshi
    - dialogue: so there are multiple questions which you've asked. so let me try
        to address all your questions. the number one question is on what would be
        the share of mfi in your loan book. you've seen that over the past 3 years,
        we've been continuously reducing the share of the mfi. it was close to 13-14%,
        which is now gradually reduced to 9%. we want to keep it around to 8% to 10%.
        i think that is the optimal size of the mfi book. that's our first step. we
        are also diversifying our overall rural business. we continue to believe that
        rural is a great opportunity in the country, and we continue to diversify
        this book. we are also launching a segment called bharat vikas banking, which
        will house our rural focused businesses including merchant acquiring business,
        other bharat financial businesses and some other rural products such as small
        sme loans will also start getting launched in this vertical. we are diversifying
        this business from micro finance into bharat vikas banking so that we don't
        compromise on the growth of this segment. while it’s given that the mfi business
        is cyclical in nature, we continue to believe that across cycles, mfi business
        should give you 2.5% to 3% roa. in some years, it can give you 4%, in some
        years it can give you 1.5% also. so i'm saying 2.5% to 3% roa across the cycle
        in this business. and if you look at this business on a holistic basis, i
        think it's an efficient business if done well. you need to keep buffer provisions
        in this business. i believe if you continue to keep 2% of the book as buffer
        provisions, you should be able to manage the stress. i've always said this
        book will run at a credit cost of towards 2.5% to 3.5%. you keep a 2% buffer
        provisions and in a cyclical trend, it should be able to take care by plus/minus
        1%. that's how you should manage this business. i hope i have been able to
        answer your questions.
      speaker: Sumant Kathpalia
    - dialogue: 'yes. and then i have one on deposits. when i think about kind of
        your stable deposits within your retail deposits, it''s about 5% of the total
        lcr retail deposits. why is that page 9 of 16 IndusInd Bank Limited

        January 31, 2025

        number that low? If I think about your branch franchise in number of Tier
        2, Tier 3

        cities, Tier 4 cities, that granularity should be higher, but how that stable
        deposit

        number is a little low. I''m just wondering how that can be improved.'
      speaker: Chintan Joshi
    - dialogue: chintan, there are different ways in which some of these guidelines
        are interpreted. you would notice that some banks have very low number, some
        banks have slightly higher numbers. i'll take you through granularity offline
        through a separate discussion.
      speaker: Indrajit Yadav
  Jai Mundhra:
    analyst_company: ICICI Securities
    dialogue:
    - dialogue: sir, just a few questions. first, on mfi or bfil, do we also cross-sell
        any 2-wheeler or personal loan or a small cv to these customers? and if yes,
        what would be the exposure?
      speaker: Jai Mundhra
    - dialogue: we don't do any personal loans on this segment. it's already an unsecured
        segment. so we don't want to increase unsecured exposure in this segment any
        further. we did try scooter loans. we did about 2,000 scooter loans. we did
        it as a pilot and stopped it as the delinquencies were high.
      speaker: Sumant Kathpalia
    - dialogue: right. so there is no other exposure, right? i mean there is no other
        retail products or any other?
      speaker: Jai Mundhra
    - dialogue: we don't believe that we can do any other cross-sell into the except
        liabilities, which we talked about rs.2,600 crores of deposits.
      speaker: Sumant Kathpalia
    - dialogue: right. sure. secondly, sir, if you can also highlight the net npa
        in mfi, right, that will help give us some direction in terms of the additional
        provisioning needed. you have a gross npa of inr2,400 crores. and if you can
        sort of quantify what is the pcr here? or what is the net npa here?
      speaker: Jai Mundhra
    - dialogue: our pcr overall is 70%, like indrajit said, we don't give product
        specific net npa or provisions. so i think that is not something we give it
        in public domain, but i can tell you that we are well provided and well covered.
      speaker: Sumant Kathpalia
    - dialogue: sure. and lastly, sumant, if i look at the contingent provisions that
        we have right now, that is roughly around 4% of the mfi loans. and you have
        said that sma 1 plus 2 is around 4%. so are we sort of done in terms of whatever
        additional slippages that come through in fourth quarter, you will be providing
        those, or we may continue to carry this contingent provisions going ahead
        in fy '26. is that the way to think about this? or there would be some change
        in this contingent stock?
      speaker: Jai Mundhra
    - dialogue: it's too early to comment on whether we will use contingent provisions
        or not. i've always said the bank should be adequately covered and we will
        always be conservative on provisions and to make sure that we have enough
        coverage to take care of any eventuality especially in the highly volatile
        businesses, like micro finance. we also want to be prepared for the ecl when
        it comes in. so, given these 2 scenarios, we continue to believe that the
        bank should carry enough contingent provisions as we move forward. whether
        we will use anything, it's way too early. we will see how the flows happen
        in the mfi, how the business goes and then we will take a call.
      speaker: Sumant Kathpalia
    - dialogue: 'sure, sir. and lastly, sir, i think there was an exit of cfo. and
        of course, we have already disclosed that. if you can comment on any other
        attrition that you are seeing at the senior level? or if you want to sort
        of comment on that thing? page 13 of 16 IndusInd Bank Limited

        January 31, 2025'
      speaker: Jai Mundhra
    - dialogue: so we have a very stable management team. if you look at it, over
        the period, a lot of earlier people have gone and new people have come in,
        whether it's the cto, cro, cco or internal audit head. we've got a lot of
        new people. so we've always said that a good mix of management will always
        have a good understanding of the business, and we get a new perspective on
        the business from lateral hires. having said that, the hr head is here, and
        maybe he can comment on it.
      speaker: Sumant Kathpalia
    - dialogue: thanks, sumant. we had a very stable leadership right from 2008 to
        2020. simply because of the age of the people at a particular point of time,
        people retired at the same time, and we added a lot of new people. so there
        is a good blend of old and the new, with more new now. and again, this year,
        i guess, we'll have a couple of people retiring together. so we are already
        in the process of identifying people. we will not be having any position unfilled
        for any length of time. and so our backfill hiring for these positions continue
        and we will be sorted on our top management talent at all times.
      speaker: Zubin Mody
  Kunal Shah:
    analyst_company: Citigroup
    dialogue:
    - dialogue: i just missed out in terms of the utilization of the contingency buffer
        was that towards the corporate account or it was towards the mfi?
      speaker: Kunal Shah
    - dialogue: so rs.160 crores was towards the mfi and rs.40 crores was towards
        the corporate account.
      speaker: Sumant Kathpalia
    - dialogue: going forward, as you mentioned, slippages might remain elevated in
        4q as well. there are various cuts which have been given, there are additional
        disclosures on the mfi front. but looking at it in terms of what could be
        the overall stress, which we are seeing because on the x bucket, we have already
        seen 99.5% collection efficiency now. so we would be having the good handle
        in terms of what is the level of stress. so how much could be the slippage?
        what could be the provisioning against it? and would there be further utilization
        of contingency buffer in 4q?
      speaker: Kunal Shah
    - dialogue: so we can't guide you on the contingency buffer utilization, but the
        30 to 90 dpd, which is a good indicator of the stress and slippages, is still
        elevated at 4% because october and november were challenging months for micro
        finance.
      speaker: Sumant Kathpalia
    - dialogue: and that provisioning will still continue?
      speaker: Kunal Shah
    - dialogue: if you look at the resolution rates, which happen in the 30+ buckets,
        it's a bit low in the micro finance segment.
      speaker: Sumant Kathpalia
    - dialogue: okay. got it. and secondly, when we look at it in terms of the overall
        margin front, so given that there would have been interest reversals on higher
        level of slippages. but otherwise, given the initiatives which we have taken,
        and given in the rate cut environment, we should be more beneficial given
        the profile of our portfolio? where do we see margins eventually settling
        now given that interest reversals would be more or less behind us?
      speaker: Kunal Shah
    - dialogue: it is difficult to give a guidance on the margins as of now. i would
        like to see quarter 4 playing out and micro finance segment stabilizing. and
        then we have to see what the policy rate announcements are from the rbi or
        the rate cuts which come in. and then we can share our expectations on the
        margin. i'd like to wait for the next quarter before we give any guidance
        on this as of now.
      speaker: Sumant Kathpalia
    - dialogue: okay. and just lastly, you mentioned you will be watchful of the mfin
        2.0 guardrails. when we look at our portfolio, almost like 16-odd percent
        is something wherein it's bfil plus 2. so how do we see maybe are the collection
        efficiencies in this pool relatively worse off? and if it doesn't get refinanced,
        do we see the pain continuing even in 1q of next year? you have clearly guided
        for 4q, but is that the risk of spillover in 1q as well?
      speaker: Kunal Shah
    - dialogue: 'so we''ve also given a graph, if you go to the second page of additional
        micro loan disclosures. collection efficiency on 0 dpd bucket are now at higher
        percentage. page 7 of 16 IndusInd Bank Limited

        January 31, 2025

        Flows were coming when it was close to 98.3% or 98.4% and the flow rates were

        about 1.6% to 1.7%.

        These rates have now improved with collection efficiency at 99.5% in the 0
        DPD

        bucket. So the forward flows have reduced, which is what we were observing,
        and it

        has happened in December and so is the case in January.

        We continue to watch this space. That''s why I said that we are cautious about
        the

        micro finance segment. And I think we will continue to wait and watch before
        we

        press the accelerator. You know that we used to do disbursements of Rs.14,000
        -

        15,000 crores a quarter, but now down to INR9,000 crores. And I think just
        pressing

        the accelerator on disbursement may not be the right approach. We want to
        wait and

        watch and see how this plays out, see the balancing of our book.

        We want to press the accelerator when 30 to 90 becomes within a range amount
        of

        1% to 1.2%. That''s our objective. And we are putting all our processes, collection

        efficiencies in place to make sure that, that happens first.'
      speaker: Sumant Kathpalia
  Piran Engineer:
    analyst_company: CLSA India
    dialogue:
    - dialogue: congrats on the quarter in this challenging environment. just circling
        back to micro finance. firstly, is january better than december, if you can
        comment obviously, on collections, not growth?
      speaker: Piran Engineer
    - dialogue: if you look at the forward flows, it looks better in the 0-dpd bucket.
        but if you look at what has flown into the 30-plus bucket, what had accrued
        in october and november, we are seeing that some npa flows are happening from
        that bucket as of now.
      speaker: Sumant Kathpalia
    - dialogue: okay. understood. so stage 2 flowing into stage 3.
      speaker: Piran Engineer
    - dialogue: yes. so what is encouraging is the forward flows in 0-dpd bucket have
        stabilized, and it has improved.
      speaker: Sumant Kathpalia
    - dialogue: fair enough. and given that the new guidelines in mfi will be out
        in april, have we proactively stopped this 2 plus 1, i mean, have you moved
        to 2 plus 1? or are we still okay being the fourth lender if a proposal comes
        right now?
      speaker: Piran Engineer
    - dialogue: so if you look at the data which we have given in presentation, 86%
        of our business is bfil plus 2. and we want to get that to 95% to 98%.
      speaker: Sumant Kathpalia
    - dialogue: no, no. i get that. eventually, it has to be 100%. my question is,
        right now, if you're getting a proposal where you're the fourth lender, okay,
        let's say, today on 31st jan, will you take it up? or will you say no anyway
        in 2 months, you can't do it. so why do it now? that's my question.
      speaker: Piran Engineer
    - dialogue: yes. we already have got put in our system that any new customers,
        we will not have bfil plus 2. and for an existing customer, maximum, we'll
        allow 1 more lender. and when the mfin guidelines come, the latest rule we
        need to change that for a new or existing relationship, it will be bfil plus
        2. in terms of business impact, i think it will not be significant. we will
        manage, but for quite some time, we have been having the higher number of
        lenders who were built into the system.
      speaker: J Sridharan
    - dialogue: got it. and sir, since you're on the call, how should we think about
        mfi industry growth once all this is settled, say, 2 quarters later? because
        clearly, i think the industry is maxed out on the number of the tam in terms
        of number of borrowers and then should we just think of it as a ticket size,
        which is similar to inflation. so the mfi industry grows at 6%, 7%? or how
        do we think about industry growth here?
      speaker: Piran Engineer
    - dialogue: 'i believe the industry is likely to grow 15%-16% with new geographies
        getting added. still there are pockets in the country where lending is not
        taking place, whether we will participate in that and how the industry will
        move there is what we need to see. if you see the growth post the rbi unification
        of the guideline that growth has been quite significant, and there is also
        only a 10% degrowth from the highs. so the overall picture, whether mfi industry
        will continue to grow at 25%, i don''t believe so. 10% to 15% growth in the
        jlg model is likely to be there, but that also will come more from newer geographies
        and less from new customers in the existing geographies. page 10 of 16 IndusInd

  Rikin Shah:
    analyst_company: IIFL
    dialogue:
    - dialogue: just a couple of questions. the first one is on yields. so while the
        interest reversals due to elevated slippages are understandable. but if you
        look at the corporate loan yields, they have been declining in the last 4
        quarters sequentially. so what is the reason there? because we have been growing
        the small business loans faster than the large corporate. so that's question
        number one. and second question is on the asset quality. so even barring mfi,
        the npas in all other segments have inched up sequentially. and even the slippages
        in cfd is relatively elevated. so what's the outlook on the slippages in the
        coming quarters? those are my two questions.
      speaker: Rikin Shah
    - dialogue: 'so let me answer the first question on the corporate yields. if you
        look at the corporate yield, there are two reasons for it. one is, we manage
        our risk weights well. and that is important to us and also to make sure that
        the excess liquidity rather than going into the reverse repo, managed to move
        towards the good quality accounts with aa and aaa-rating. and that is where
        we are willing to give away yield. the weighted average risk weights have
        come down to 2.47 as explained earlier in the corporate book from 2.54 yoy.
        so we''ve actually managed our risk weights well. the second reason for that
        is the eblr repricing has happened on the loan book. so a lot of these corporate
        bank loans are floating rate loans. they''re not fixed rate loans. and i think
        the eblr repricing where it''s linked to external benchmark rates have got
        repriced. the second question was on how do you see the flows and i think
        it''s too early to comment. like i told that our vehicle finance has gone
        through a turbulent period. and in good times, it gives you 110 to 120 basis
        points of credit cost and in bad time, gives you 130 to 140 basis points of
        credit costs. so, while the gross npa flows may look elevated, but the recovery
        in the vehicle finance book is relatively higher. and that is where i believe
        that the vehicle finance is a good book, which is managed in range bound credit
        cost. on the other retail loans, which has seen the flows is mainly because
        of the credit card business. and the credit card flows are at a higher level
        right now. you know the industry is going through a stress in the unsecured
        business. the good part is, they are now moderating. we''ve seen stability
        of forward flows now. and i think in the next 2 quarters, you should start
        seeing a reduction in the flows from the other retail book also. page 8 of
        16 IndusInd Bank Limited

        January 31, 2025

        On micro finance, I will say that we have to continue to watch this space.
        The

        explanation which we gave to Kunal stands here also, I continue to believe
        that the

        forward flows are now looking better. But I think we still have to be conservative
        and

        cautious about this space.'
      speaker: Sumant Kathpalia
    - dialogue: got it, sir. and i have 1 more question, if i may squeeze in. it's
        on deposits. so is there any further debulking of deposits likely in the coming
        quarters? or now the overall deposit growth should kind of move in line with
        the retail deposit growth?
      speaker: Rikin Shah
    - dialogue: so i believe that we will continue to reduce our bulk deposits. i've
        said that before. and we have shared our expectations to the market of having
        48% to 50% share of retail lcr deposits and loan deposit ratio of around 88%
        to 90%. so that's the only guidance we can give you and we will continue to
        do what is necessary to granularize the liability.
      speaker: Sumant Kathpalia
  Shubhranshu Mishra:
    analyst_company: PhillipCapital
    dialogue:
    - dialogue: 'the first one is on credit cards, the gross npa has inched up on
        a sequential basis. and just wanted to understand the architecture of our
        enr share, what percentage is transactors, how much is revolvers and how much
        are the emi proportion? if you can speak about the number of credit card customers
        who have 2 or more credit cards? 3 plus credit cards and 4 plus credit cards.
        that''s on the credit card. the second one is on vehicle financing, especially
        the scv, lcv, hcv, there''s been commentary around asset quality rip off and
        slowdown here. so how do we see this market and what has been our experience?
        and what do we think of the growth levels in these 3 specific segments going
        forward in the next year including small commercial vehicle, light commercial
        vehicle and medium and heavy commercial vehicle? a. g. sriram: commercial
        vehicle is behaving well, the portfolio has been improving, and i believe
        it will continue to improve. light commercial vehicle, as people have given
        more loans towards the new to credit, there will be some increased slippages,
        but it will be compensated by the higher rate of interest. small commercial
        vehicle, again, the same way like nearly 50%-60% are new to credit wherein
        quite a bit of default occurs. but loss given default (lgd) is somewhere around
        45%. the yields in small commercial vehicle is higher than light commercial
        vehicle and heavy commercial vehicle. so overall, roa of the product is good
        and it gives you a good customer base.'
      speaker: Shubhranshu Mishra
    - dialogue: and the credit card question.
      speaker: Shubhranshu Mishra
    - dialogue: yes. so you know that our unsecured business, including personal loan
        is a very small portion. it's only 6% of our book. we've always said that
        because we have micro finance, we will keep it around 6%. of this, 3% is credit
        card and 2.5% is personal loans on that segment. our credit card gnpa are
        elevated because you know the industry issues which are coming in. and the
        gross flows are elevated as of now. and if you look at the other retail flows,
        most of it is coming from the credit card businesses, the slippages. having
        said that, we have 24% of our base has revolvers and 16% alop or emi based
        customers. so 40% of the base either is revolving or alop-related emi customers.
        on the second question part of your question, well, how many customers are
        with 3 to 4 credit cards, i don't have the ready-made answer. it may be in
        the data pack, but i don't recall that answer. so we will come back to you
        later on this answer.
      speaker: Sumant Kathpalia
    - dialogue: just one question, if i can squeeze in. what is the percentage of
        open market sourcing in credit cards?
      speaker: Shubhranshu Mishra
    - dialogue: 'what do you mean by open market sourcing, if you can? page 14 of
        16 IndusInd Bank Limited

        January 31, 2025'
      speaker: Sumant Kathpalia
    - dialogue: not from our own liability or asset customers?
      speaker: Shubhranshu Mishra
    - dialogue: it is difficult to give an answer on this. our focus is on our liability
        base. but we are also very stringent on our parameters on our internal customers
        also as to what we want to source. what we source in the open market are more
        salaried customers because we want to get the salary relationships out there.
        and what we get on our customer base are salaried and self-employed. the mix,
        we cannot share right now.
      speaker: Sumant Kathpalia
commentary:
- dialogue: 'good evening and thank you for joining this call. let me start with some
    macro commentary and then go into the bank specific details. recent trends in
    high-frequency indicators suggest stability in economic activity after the slowdown
    in q2. a recovery in rural demand and a festive season boost to urban demand is
    aiding to private consumption. however, a contraction in public capex in h1 and
    a sluggish recovery thereafter have weighed on investment growth. the union budget
    due to be presented tomorrow may address growth slowdown this year by retaining
    focus on investments on the spending side and continuing tax policy reforms to
    improve compliance while signalling commitment towards fiscal discipline. any
    potential measures supporting rural as well as overall economic activity should
    aid our microfinance and vehicle finance businesses. coming to the quarter specific
    developments, the key highlights for the quarter were:  robust retail deposit
    growth – we maintained momentum in retail deposit mobilisation during the quarter
    with 4% qoq and 14% yoy growth. the share of retail deposits as per lcr improved
    to 46.1% vs. 44.1% qoq. we, however, consciously let go some of the non lcr accretive
    wholesale deposits during the quarter and as a result, overall deposits declining
    1% qoq.  calibrated loan growth – we continued to grow our loan book in calibrated
    manner being watchful of the developments across segments. overall loan growth
    was at 12% yoy and 3% qoq. our vehicle and microfinance businesses saw robust
    pick up in disbursements sequentially. momentum continued in other retail loans
    and corporate book growing 19% and 16% respectively.  progress on new initiatives
    – our liabilities initiatives of affluent and nri banking maintained healthy growth
    rates of 20% and 39% yoy respectively. loan book under merchant business at rs.6,319
    crores grew 32% yoy while home loan book at rs.3,144 crores grew 128% yoy. our
    digital banking offering indie, is now opened up to all customers of the bank
    as the upgraded digital application and we are seeing positive trend amongst the
    early adopters.  asset quality – our gross npa & net npa were at 2.25% and 0.68%
    respectively. gross slippages were at rs.2,200 crores and net slippages were at
    rs.1,860 crores. the slippages were higher in microfinance segment given the industry
    situation. asset quality trends in rest of the businesses remained broadly stable.
    the restructured book, sma 1&2 loans and sr book saw improvement yoy and qoq.
     ensured stability in financial metrics – our roa was stable at 1.03% vs 1.00%
    qoq. the lower nims due to rundown in microfinance book was offset by strong other
    income and cost control. our capital adequacy ratios remain healthy with cet1
    at 15.18% and crar at 16.46%. page 2 of 16 IndusInd Bank Limited

- dialogue: ' vehicle finance business saw improvement both in terms of disbursements
    and asset quality during the quarter.  vehicle disbursements for q3 were at rs.13,388
    crores growing 25% qoq and almost at similar levels yoy. this quarter thus reversed
    the trend of yoy and qoq decline in disbursements in the last several quarters.
     we saw yoy growth in disbursements for mhcv, construction equipments and two
    wheelers. passenger vehicles and scv saw yoy decline in disbursements. tractors
    and lcv too saw robust improvement sequentially, albeit it’s still lower yoy.
     the sequential vehicle loan growth thus accelerated to 3% from 1% last quarter.
    the yoy growth was at 9% broadly reflecting the underlying industry performance.
     the gross slippages in vehicle finance were stable at 0.74% vs 0.73% yoy and
    0.77% qoq. the commercial vehicles, passenger vehicles and construction equipments
    saw yoy and qoq improvement in slippages whereas tractors and 2-wheelers saw comparatively
    higher slippages.  the restructured book in vehicle finance continues to reduce
    at rs.231 crores vs rs.309 crores qoq with majority of the reduction coming from
    upgrades & recoveries.  overall, the vehicle industry should see recovery in
    volumes aided by government spends and possibly lower interest rate environment.
    with improved diversification across product categories, we remain well positioned
    to benefit once the industry sees recovery. 2. bharat financial inclusion limited
    (bfil):  outstanding loan book originated via bfil now stands at rs.38,883 crores
    growing by 1% qoq and down 4% yoy.  microfinance o microfinance segment witnessed
    sequential improvement in disbursements driven by pent-up demand as well as improving
    eligibility of centres as well as customers. o the disbursements of rs.9,200 crores
    were largely in line with the repayments and thus arresting sharp drop in the
    loan book witnessed since march-24. o we remain cautious on the growth with disbursements
    well below our historical runrates as well as customer eligibility. geographically,
    amongst the key states, portfolio grew sequentially in maharashtra and odisha
    whereas degrew in karnataka and uttar pradesh. o the 30-90 dpd book was stable
    at 4.0% vs 4.1% qoq. o we have provided a few additional disclosures on microfinance
    covering disbursement as well as asset quality indicators. the disbursements are
    concentrated towards vintage customers and centers. the incremental stress in
    microfinance seems to be peaking out as seen in reducing forward flows from 0-dpd
    customers. we can discuss these further in q&a.  bharat super shop i.e. the merchant
    acquiring business o we have now around 660k merchant borrowers under this program.
    page 3 of 16 IndusInd Bank Limited

    January 31, 2025

    o Our merchant loan book at Rs.6,319 crores grew by 32% YoY & 9%

    QoQ.

     The share of non-MFI book improved to 16% vs 12% YoY.

     Total liabilities sourced through BFIL now stand at Rs.2,610 crores with 19mn

    SA and RD accounts.

     Gross slippages from BFIL increased to Rs.695 crores during the quarter.

     We remain committed to the business with investment on technology and

    analytics as well as human resources adding around 10,000 more employees

    during last one year in BFIL.

    Overall, while incremental stress formation is showing early signs of stability,
    we

    continue to be cautious on the microfinance segment. We are also watchful of

    implications from the new MFIN guidelines once they get implemented.

    Nevertheless, we continue to believe in our approach of addressing focusing on

    1) funding requirements of vintage customers and centres, 2) being conservative

    on overall customer industry indebtedness, 3) investing in collection

    infrastructure and 4) continued diversification of the loan book.
