    dialogue:
    - dialogue: i just wanted to understand the benefit, if any, which you will see
        from the ongoing kumbh mela. so, will we see a sharp increase in ticketing
        volumes? and what should be the approximate quantification of that? and moreover,
        what can be the potential improvement in both catering and rail neer revenue
        from the ongoing kumbh mela.
      speaker: Balaji
    - dialogue: 'you see it''s one of its kind. here, what specifically we have done
        that i can share with you. we have -- we are running 8 bharat gaurav tourist
        trains in this area, covering prayagraj, varanasi page 8 of 13 Indian Railway

        February 11, 2025

        and Ayodhya. So there, we are bringing thousands of people there on our train.
        This will be

        where the ticket is ours, the whole tourist package is ours. Second, that
        we have created, set up

        100 rooms, 100 tents, Mahakumbh Gram-Tent City of IRCTC, which is fully sold
        out. So, these

        are the direct things which we are doing. Besides that, you know that everybody
        is moving

        towards that. And railway has run so many special trains also. And so, we
        are getting benefit in

        all our like ticketing, Catering and Rail Neer, as you correctly pointed out.
        Thank you very much.'
      speaker: Sanjay Kumar Jain
    - dialogue: this is helpful. so, any sense on the numbers, if you could provide
        based on how it has been for the past one month?
      speaker: Balaji
    - dialogue: if you want, i have to calculate, otherwise, because this will come
        in this quarter only, you can wait.
      speaker: Sanjay Kumar Jain
  Deepak:
    analyst_company: Sundaram Mutual Funds
    dialogue:
    - dialogue: sir, my first question is with respect to catering. so, i just wanted
        to understand the relationship between our tariff rate increase and license
        fees. first, i was reading in one of the document by railway board that for
        the current running contract, let's say, even if the tariff hike comes in
        the food menu, there won't be any change to the license fee for the contracts
        which are currently running. is that understanding, correct? so basically,
        there won't be any material impact on, let's say, increase in the license
        fee because of, let's say, higher revision of tariffs. is that understanding,
        correct?
      speaker: Deepak
    - dialogue: your question is finished? should i come or should i wait for the
        next question?
      speaker: Sanjay Kumar Jain
    - dialogue: sir, i'll ask one by one, so that it's easier for you to answer.
      speaker: Deepak
    - dialogue: so, as you correctly read, there is -- there will not be any impact
        on license fee if the tariff is enhanced because that has also -- that has
        been clearly indicated in the tender document. so whatever benefit they are
        expecting to derive because of the tariff enhancement has already been considered
        by the bidders of the tenders while bidding.
      speaker: Sanjay Kumar Jain
    - dialogue: and a second question, what would be our vande bharat train revenue
        contribution to catering and internet ticketing separately in this quarter,
        q3?
      speaker: Deepak
    - dialogue: 'we''ll let you know. thank you. page 5 of 13 Indian Railway Catering

      speaker: Sanjay Kumar Jain
    - dialogue: and sir, coming to internet ticketing. so, this quarter, we saw a
        5% q-o-q decline in internet ticketing. but despite that, our margins have
        improved by 3, 4 percentage points. so, i just wanted to understand, is that
        margin sustainable? or is it one-off in q3?
      speaker: Deepak
    - dialogue: you see, if you see quarter-by-quarter, you are correct that our internet
        ticketing revenue is less. it is because of the seasonal nature of bookings.
        so, in our q2, we have booked tickets of all the seasons like diwali, dussehra,
        chhath, which was -- which is not there in q3. but if you compare with q3
        '24, there is an improvement of 5%. and if you also see the 9-month performance
        in it ticketing revenue, it has also increased to inr1,054 crores as against
        inr953 crores, giving around 11% growth.
      speaker: Sanjay Kumar Jain
    - dialogue: sir, i understand that. my question was despite a 5% q-o-q decline
        in revenue, our margins have improved. okay. so, i just wanted to understand,
        is that margin which we are currently reporting, 84.7%, is it sustainable
        going forward?
      speaker: Deepak
    - dialogue: that you see this all depends on the type of booking. like when we
        talk of overall it earnings, it consists of 2 things. one is convenience fee
        and another is your nfr, non-fare revenue. so, when we are already doing 87%
        of the booking, now we are trying to maximize our non-fare revenues. so, this
        is what will happen now, and that is what has happened.
      speaker: Sanjay Kumar Jain
    - dialogue: okay. so basically, the non-convenience fees portion as proportion
        revenue has gone up. that's why we see an increment in the margins. is that
        understanding, correct?
      speaker: Deepak
    - dialogue: yes, please.
      speaker: Sanjay Kumar Jain
    - dialogue: and sir, my final question would be with respect to tourism. so, you
        have already provided in your opening remarks that because of luxury trains
        and tejas and state teerth, we saw a very good comeback on tourism revenue
        this quarter. so, is it sustainable going forward? or was it kind of one-off
        because of some events which is happening? and is the margin sustainable?
        because i think this quarter, we have reported the highest margin in tourism.
        is it sustainable?
      speaker: Deepak
    - dialogue: of course, yes. rather, we'll grow further.
      speaker: Sanjay Kumar Jain
    - dialogue: okay. on margin front?
      speaker: Deepak
    - dialogue: 'you see, if you see our luxury train, last year, we did overall in
        the year inr65 crores. this year, we are expected to come up to more than
        inr95 crores, and it is giving us around 30% operating margin of our business.
        so, these kinds of products are already -- you see, there is a euphoria for
        tourism. all of the world, they are trying to see towards india. so, we are
        increasing our share of luxury trains, be it maharaja express or golden chariot.
        i''m happy to share that for the first time after 2019, we have -- we could
        run golden chariot and there is a good buzz in the market about that. so,
        this will continue. we have taken additional rake of bharat gaurav train because
        we are having the business out of that. that is also -- that will also add
        both revenue and the margin to us. so, i''m seeing margin -- i don''t find
        any reason why, the margin will not be either at the same level or improve
        further. page 6 of 13 Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Limited

        February 11, 2025'
      speaker: Sanjay Kumar Jain
    - dialogue: okay, sir. very encouraging, sir. sir, my final question would be
        with respect to one of the regulations, which has kicked in that the advance
        booking has come down from 4 months to around 2 months, right? and that has
        impact on the revenue with respect to the cancelled ticket, right? because
        we collect our convenience fees even on the cancelled tickets. so, i just
        want to understand on average, i mean, how much revenue in the internet ticketing
        convenience fees, do we get from cancelled ticket? and what could be the,
        let's say, revenue loss because of this implication of advance window coming
        down from 4 months to 2 months?
      speaker: Deepak
    - dialogue: actually, so far as the number of days of erp is concerned, it will
        not cause any difference in convenience fees, first thing. because there are
        number of fleets are there and every day, there is -- you see many trains
        -- you see large investment has taken place in railways since last 3, 4 years.
        and this year also, there is a good budget capex support to the railways.
        so, all these things will make it possible to run more and more number of
        trains. so far as the capacity is concerned, that will -- that is bound to
        increase or enhance. and we should not subject to -- we should not be very,
        very selfish that we earn out of the cancellation charge. so, what we should
        focus is how we can provide better and better services and more and more ticket
        booking. so, our target is that. so, i see it with that perspective. and there,
        i am finding the business is used to come to us. thank you very much.
      speaker: Sanjay Kumar Jain
    - dialogue: sir, that is fine. your goal and your inclination towards public service,
        that's very encouraging. but what i wanted to understand ask you in simple
        terms that out of this inr254 crores convenience fees, which you booked in
        q3, how much of that has means, what is the proportion of cancelled ticket
        revenue in this inr254 crores?
      speaker: Deepak
    - dialogue: one thing i want to share with you, the cancellation -- when the tickets
        are cancelled, earlier also, we were not taking -- charging anything. we used
        to take convenience fee only and only on -- at the time of booking. so, it
        will not have any impact on to us.
      speaker: Sanjay Kumar Jain
  Jinesh Joshi:
    analyst_company: PL Capital
    dialogue:
    - dialogue: sir, i want to understand how launch of swa rail is likely to impact
        our business. now what i understand is that this app is developed by cris
        and every online transaction basically will be routed through our booking
        engine which effectively means that there is no loss of business for us. but
        what i want to know is how will cris benefit out of this? i mean, do we have
        to pay any share to them from the convenience fee that we earn? or will they
        take an additional fee over and above what we charge from the consumer to
        make money? so just some clarification on that side.
      speaker: Jinesh Joshi
    - dialogue: thank you, jinesh. your question is about super app application. this
        will have no impact on our convenience fee because this is just one of the
        many modes which we are doing. so, to my mind, to our mind, this will make
        no difference because the convenience fee, whatever is being charged to the
        passengers will be coming straight to irctc.
      speaker: Sanjay Kumar Jain
    - dialogue: perfect. and we don't have to share any quantum with them, right?
      speaker: Jinesh Joshi
    - dialogue: no, no. i already explained it to you that there is no change in anything.
        we will get the share as we are getting as of now. this is just one-off.
      speaker: Sanjay Kumar Jain
    - dialogue: got it, sir. and sir, my second question is on our e-catering business.
        just wanted to get some update on that side because we have tied up with swiggy
        and zomato since quite some time to expand our e-catering business. so, i
        mean, can you share the progress over here? i mean, how many stations have
        we covered so far or any volume number that you may want to call out? and
        lastly, what is our e-catering?
      speaker: Jinesh Joshi
    - dialogue: may i come in jinesh? i'm happy to inform you all that from a bigger
        like 2,000 average meals per day a few quarters back -- this quarter, we have
        done more than 1 lakh average meals per day, not orders, meals per day. so,
        in -- if you compare our year-on-year basis, last year, it was 61,522 meals
        per day. this quarter, we have done 102,561 meals per day. on a quarter-on-
        quarter basis also, last quarter, q2, it was 47000. so, we are growing very
        fast.
      speaker: Sanjay Kumar Jain
    - dialogue: 'possible to share what is the contribution of e-catering revenue,
        the total catering revenue? any number you want to call out? Indian Railway

        depreciation charge. I believe the new office building was supposed to be
        capitalized in October

        ''24. But if I look at our depreciation run rate, I mean, it is similar to
        what it was in the previous

        quarter. So just wanted to know if that building has been capitalized or not.
        And once the

        capitalization happens, what should be our quarterly run rate on the depreciation
        side.'
      speaker: Jinesh Joshi
  Madhuchanda Dey:
    analyst_company: Money control Pro
    dialogue:
    - dialogue: i have a housekeeping question. sir, the first one, which is if your
        convenience fee is inr254 crores, so the non-ticketing is about inr100 crores.
        is that the correct figure? and if you could share the figure for the corresponding
        quarter, which is q3 fy '24.
      speaker: Madhuchanda Dey
    - dialogue: so, this is inr239 crores is the convenience fee q3 '24 and inr96
        crores is the non-convenience fee, inr96 crores in q3 '24.
      speaker: Sanjay Kumar Jain
    - dialogue: and the number of tickets sold is 11.46 crores or that's a different
        number?
      speaker: Madhuchanda Dey
    - dialogue: yes. on year-on-year basis, the tickets sold is 12.51 crores this
        year. and last year, it was 11.48 crores, which is 9% of the total sale of
        ticket, which has increased.
      speaker: Sanjay Kumar Jain
    - dialogue: 'okay. got it. i have a very simple question. if you could explain,
        you ended last year, which is fy ''24 on a catering margin of 13.8%. but i
        mean now that is at around 12.2%. i mean just wanted to understand what is
        the trajectory? what is pulling down the catering margin? page 7 of 13 Indian
        Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Limited

        February 11, 2025'
      speaker: Madhuchanda Dey
    - dialogue: so, if you see the catering margin, we have already explained when
        director of finance was explaining that there are 2, 3 things which has come
        in the way. first is that we have closed down our base kitchens, 9 base kitchens,
        which we are running on departmental basis that was closed because of the
        new catering policy wherein now we have gone for licensing model. so there,
        immediately, it is seeing that there is a squeeze in the margin. but overall,
        if you see the number of trains which are coming, so the margin will certainly
        improve. then if you see this - - if you see the absolute terms, it has improved.
        the second thing is the new tendering process, which we have done through
        clustering mode, here we are not charging 15% on a billing. and our main focus
        is now on creating infrastructure, a network of base kitchens all across india
        so that -- which we are envisaging that a large number of catering business
        is going to come to irctc because of the introduction of many new trains in
        the coming quarters and the years. so, we are preparing ourselves by creating
        sufficient infrastructure so that we don't lose on that account. so, margin
        is going to improve.
      speaker: Sanjay Kumar Jain
    - dialogue: yes. i have a last question, if i may. that is on the rail neer. was
        there any capacity addition in this quarter -- fresh capacity came on board?
        and what kind of capacity addition are we going to see in the next few quarters?
      speaker: Madhuchanda Dey
    - dialogue: so recently, we have added vijayawada plant, which we inaugurated
        on 7th of october '24. and there are 3 plants which we are planning to bring
        in the coming financial year. so that will also add to our capacity by, say,
        around l,50,000 bottles and more, i think it's 2 lakhs bottles.
      speaker: Sanjay Kumar Jain
    - dialogue: so, what's the current capacity if you could just mention that after
        this new plant?
      speaker: Madhuchanda Dey
    - dialogue: total capacity is 18.4 lakhs bottles per day.
      speaker: Sanjay Kumar Jain
    - dialogue: okay. that is now. and is it going to go up to?
      speaker: Madhuchanda Dey
    - dialogue: add around 2 lakh bottles.
      speaker: Sanjay Kumar Jain
    - dialogue: by which quarter?
      speaker: Madhuchanda Dey
    - dialogue: in the coming financial year.
      speaker: Sanjay Kumar Jain
    - dialogue: okay. roughly in the second half, right?
      speaker: Madhuchanda Dey
    - dialogue: that i can't commit now.
      speaker: Sanjay Kumar Jain
  Mohit Jain:
    analyst_company: Tara Capital
    dialogue:
    - dialogue: sir, thanks for the presentation. sir, on the internet ticketing,
        you said one of the reasons the margin has improved is because the non-fare
        revenue has increased significantly. but sir, on a y-o-y basis, it has increased
        only from inr96 crores to inr100 crores. so, then what actually explains this
        increase in the margin on ticketing -- internet ticketing from 83% to 84.7%.
        and is it sustainable as it was asked earlier also?
      speaker: Mohit Jain
    - dialogue: you see our number of tickets, which we have booked since q3 is daily
        average is 13.59 lakh tickets per day whereas it was 12.4 lakh tickets per
        day. so, this quarter, we have increased 1 lakh tickets per day on an average.
        and that much number. so that much fees also come in absolute terms. and besides
        that, from inr96 crores to we have brought to inr101 crores in non-convenience
        fee. so that's how it has improved.
      speaker: Sanjay Kumar Jain
    - dialogue: no, sir. i appreciate such increase in the profit and the revenue.
        i mean i was looking for the margin percentage. it has gone significant --
        it has increased significantly. so, i just wanted to understand that should
        we say that now this 84%, 85% is the new normal, and this is what we can expect
        going forward also?
      speaker: Mohit Jain
    - dialogue: let us hope for the best.
      speaker: Sanjay Kumar Jain
  Mohit Motwani:
    analyst_company: Tara Capital
    dialogue:
    - dialogue: sir, my question is on your opening remarks on the internet ticketing
        segment, where you said that the growth could be limited -- incremental would
        be limited from this point onwards. so, i want to understand what are the
        streams of revenue are you looking at? have you decided any streams or there
        is something going on along those lines? and this growth that we saw 5% has
        actually moderated from the last 2 quarters. so, what should we expect in
        terms of trajectory going forward? not looking for any numbers, but if you
        can give us a sense of what can be the future trajectory for this?
      speaker: Mohit Motwani
    - dialogue: as i explained earlier also, we are already reaching to 87% -- we
        have touched 87%. so, the scope of the percentage improvement is -- we are
        not foreseeing much. but as the volume itself is growing very high because
        of the investment in coaches and in infrastructure of indian railways. so
        certainly -- and with the coming up of both the dfc lines, the line capacity
        is also released for running more and more passenger trains. so, in absolute
        term, we see a very handsome business out from here. so far as margin is concerned,
        it will remain -- as percentage wise, it should remain the same in the near
        future.
      speaker: Sanjay Kumar Jain
    - dialogue: okay. and sir, on the -- can you say it again 87% -- just double clicking
        on this. and you say that 87% of the tickets are now already booked. so, would
        you say that the market has reached a saturation from a penetration point
        of view or there is scope for growth there because the other means of transport,
        if you see, right, today, airways has become more prominent? so, is that the
        case that the market has reached a little bit of saturation? that's the reason
        you're also believing that the growth from a volume standpoint may be relatively
        limited.
      speaker: Mohit Motwani
    - dialogue: no, i got your point. i got your point. there is -- i'm not telling
        that market is saturated. market is booming, but the percentage of share which
        we carries is almost 90%. so, you can understand and appreciate the situation
        that how -- what extra we can -- so we should maintain and slightly improve
        the margin when the volume increases. that is what we are planning.
      speaker: Sanjay Kumar Jain
  Nikhil Verma:
    analyst_company: SUD Life
    dialogue:
    - dialogue: my question is, sir, in the terms of catering revenue, what kind of
        volume growth you are saying? so, as you told that number of train additions
        will be there. so mostly it will be vande bharat-based trains or some other
        kind of volume growth you are seeing?
      speaker: Nikhil Verma
    - dialogue: that decision is of the ministry of railways. but so far as we are
        hearing like all of us, that besides vande bharat, vande bharat sleeper trains
        are also going to come. so that will also give us volume.
      speaker: Sanjay Kumar Jain
    - dialogue: so, sir, any kind of guidance of how much it should increase by next
        quarter or year?
      speaker: Nikhil Verma
    - dialogue: 'that we can''t predict, but there are so many rigs which are going
        to come of amrit bharat trains. page 9 of 13 Indian Railway Catering and Tourism

      speaker: Sanjay Kumar Jain
    - dialogue: and my next question is while cancelling the clerkage that is charged,
        does that go to irctc or what is the thing around that -- because i wanted
        to understand if it is free relates to the convenience fee on ayodhya.
      speaker: Nikhil Verma
    - dialogue: nikhil, i could not get you. you want to know that during cancellation
        of ticket, what clerkage charges the railway charge is going to us or to railway.
        is this your question?
      speaker: Sanjay Kumar Jain
    - dialogue: yes, sir, that is my question. yes, that is.
      speaker: Nikhil Verma
    - dialogue: so, i already explained it to the previous speaker. that we only charge
        convenience fee and that too only at the time of booking. during cancellation,
        we charge nothing.

    - dialogue: 'most of my questions have been answered. just 1 or 2 bookkeeping
        questions, if it is handy. i think we spoke about the golden chariot being
        restarted. so, if we could understand what is the seasonality for this particular
        train? is it heavy on the q3, q4 just like maharaja express? so that is point
        number one. and secondly, if you could share the contribution of luxury train
        revenue for the quarter? page 12 of 13 Indian Railway Catering and Tourism

      speaker: Rahul Jain
    - dialogue: the golden chariot is also run during the winter season, wherein foreigners,
        they generally prefer to come to india. so, it will be quarter 3, quarter
        4 like maharaja express. and so far as this segment revenue is concerned.
        maharaja express this quarter, we achieved inr38 crores revenue as against
        year-on-year, quarter 3 '24, inr27 crores. and yes, and q-on-q basis, q2 inr2
        crores.
      speaker: Sanjay Kumar Jain

        February 11, 2025'
      speaker: Rattan Joneja
    - dialogue: good evening, rattan. we have already applied for the in-principal
        approval of rbi on 12th of december. and as you know that, rbi does a scrutiny
        of any application they receive in a very threadbare manner. so, we had engaged
        some consultant, and they have planned, and we have already submitted our
        application. so hopefully, we'll get the in-principal approval of rbi soon,
        and then we'll plan to get the license as such.
      speaker: Sanjay Kumar Jain
    - dialogue: and can i ask one more question, please?
      speaker: Rattan Joneja
    - dialogue: welcome.
      speaker: Sanjay Kumar Jain
    - dialogue: okay. what is going to be the impact on irctc revenue and cost benefits
        from this license?
      speaker: Rattan Joneja
    - dialogue: you see, i'm very happy to inform you that when we have not got the
        license, and still, we are doing payment gateway business for our internal
        clients, internal customers. and i'm happy to share with you that our share
        in gross transactions value is quite handsome, around 20%, 22%. and we are
        number 1 in transaction value on website booking, and we are number 2 in mobile
        application booking. and in both the website and mobile combined or individually,
        we are ahead of paytm. so, what i understand that once we get the license
        and the opportunities in this business, what i see is huge. so that will decide
        once we get the license to our business. potential is there. i can commit
        that much.
      speaker: Sanjay Kumar Jain
    - dialogue: okay. can you elaborate on the potential please, in terms of markets
        or...
      speaker: Rattan Joneja
    - dialogue: exact numbers, i will not be able to give, but i can...
      speaker: Sanjay Kumar Jain
    - dialogue: i don't want the numbers.
      speaker: Rattan Joneja
    - dialogue: no, i can just tell you where we can have a moat. like if you see
        the railway business as such, we are only doing a part of reserve ticketing.
        the freight business is there. another your unreserved ticketing is there.
        similarly, gem is there, which is doing huge amount of business during the
        procurement. so, government business in itself. and there is no other company
        other than irctc in government parlance, which is doing this kind of business.
        so, what we are seeing is if we touch only government part, there is a huge,
        huge potential for -- on a transaction value level. thank you very much.
      speaker: Sanjay Kumar Jain
    - dialogue: and one more thing. i have a strategic question. our convenience fee
        has remained flat in terms of per pnr. well as prices of tickets have been
        rising, particularly since vande bharat has come in. so, are we thinking anything
        in terms of moving the convenience fee as a percentage of tickets -- percentage
        of the ticket value since we can then ride the inflation?
      speaker: Rattan Joneja
    - dialogue: rattan, can i come?
      speaker: Sanjay Kumar Jain
    - dialogue: yes.
      speaker: Rattan Joneja
    - dialogue: 'you have given both the question and the answer too. your question
        is how we can maximize our profit through this convenience fee by -- either
        by increasing the rate or increasing the volumes. and you see that you yourself
        told that because of coming of vande bharat train, you are seeing only part
        story of a fare enhancement of vande bharat, whereas we are seeing a page
        11 of 13 Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Limited

        February 11, 2025

        volume enhancement. And since beginning, I''m repeating this, that we are
        trying to maximize

        our volumes. Okay. So, at present, we are not seeing any enhancement in the
        rate as such.'
      speaker: Sanjay Kumar Jain
    - dialogue: no, not rate. i'm talking why don't we move into percentage so that
        we don't have to think about rates, because it's been 5 years, another 5 years
        will ago?
      speaker: Rattan Joneja
    - dialogue: leave some work up to the management. we will try to understand your
        things. but what i find, and our team find -- that you see, if you are doing
        business, you can do the -- how you should do. so here, it's a very price-sensitive
        segment. so, we are wanting to maximize our revenue and profit both by getting
        more and more business. you see already, we are making a margin of 84%, 85%.
        how much more margin you want to extract from a passenger can we share?
      speaker: Sanjay Kumar Jain

- dialogue: 'thank you, cmd sir. good evening, everyone. i hope you and your loved
    ones are in very good health. i will begin with a brief overview of our quarterly
    performance comparing it with the page 2 of 13 Indian Railway Catering and Tourism
    Corporation Limited

    February 11, 2025

    previous quarter, followed by the question-and-answer session. In Q3 financial
    year ''25, we

    achieved another quarter of robust growth with a margin of INR341.21 crores, reflecting
    a 10%

    quarter-on-quarter increase and 14% year-over-year increase. That way it''s a
    very robust growth.

    This growth was primarily driven by our Rail Neer and Tourism segment, which despite
    having

    relatively lower margin, made significant contribution to our overall revenue.

    While coming to the business segment highlights, I will mention the detail of
    all the verticals.

    First is Internet Banking. The Internet ticketing segment continued to demonstrate
    resilience

    despite nearing saturation with 87.42% approx. of the ticket now being booked
    through our

    portal. We acknowledge that incremental growth in ticket booking may be limited
    from this

    point onwards. However, we are actively exploring opportunities to enhance our
    non-

    conventional source of income beyond convenience fee.

    The segment reported revenue of INR353.72 crores, reflecting a 5.4% year-on-year
    growth with

    a slight quarter-on-quarter decline of 4.65% attributed to the seasonal surge
    in advance booking

    for the festive season. Additionally, our residual income from other sources categorized
    under

    non-convenience fee income increased by INR5.64 crores compared to the previous
    quarter.

    Despite this, the EBITDA margin remained strong at 84.71% compared to 81.03% quarter-on-

    quarter and 83.02% year-on-year, underscoring our strong market position and operational

    efficiency.

    In the Catering Segment. The Catering segment maintained strong growth momentum
    with

    revenue rising to INR554.81 crores, which is an increase of 15% quarter-on-quarter
    and 9%

    year-on-year. However, the EBITDA margin declined to 12.19% compared to 12.78%
    quarter-

    on-quarter and 15.44% year-on-year due to low margins in the segment. The revenue
    growth

    highlights the increasing demand for our catering services and our ability to
    scale operations

    effectively.

    In the Tourism segment, which witnessed a remarkable growth with the revenue reaching

    INR224 crores in the Q3 financial year ''25, marking an 80% quarter-on-quarter
    increase and

    16% increase on year-on-year increase. This exceptional performance was driven
    by the

    operation of the luxury segment, that is Maharaja Express, the State Teerth trains
    and increased

    business in the Tejas Express.

    While coming to the fourth segment, that is Rail Neer. The Rail Neer segment reported
    steady

    revenue of INR92.39 crores, reflecting a 7% quarter-on-quarter increase and a
    16% year-on-year

    increase. The EBITDA margin remained stable at 12.84% compared to 10.37% quarter-on-

    quarter. Additionally, our absolute EBITDA increased by 32% quarter-on-quarter
    and 464%

    year-on-year in this segment of Rail Neer, demonstrating our effort to enhance
    profitability by

    expanding capital utilization and adding new production capabilities.

    Overall, our Q3 financial year ''25 results highlight a successful quarter of
    growth and strategic

    execution. We remain committed to sustaining the momentum and delivering long-term
    value

    to our stakeholders. As of today, the company''s net worth is INR3,546 crores.
