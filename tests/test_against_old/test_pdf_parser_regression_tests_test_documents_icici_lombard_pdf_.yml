    dialogue:
    - dialogue: just one question. again coming to that, i mean, i recall your kind
        of focus on combined, not of claims and expenses. but more on the expenses,
        if you put together, one that each regulator now kind of looking for any kind
        of a change with their eom targets, because the rule of eom has been changed
        in between this 1/n accounting. and if you can help us, even kind of a commission
        plus opex basis, which are the business lines particularly that you see a
        bit of, i would say, intensified payouts or competition in terms of payout
        that is leading to this overall opex, including commission increase?
      speaker: Avinash Singh
    - dialogue: 'yes. so again on the point on eom, avinash, so at this point of time,
        i don''t think the regulatory is contemplating anything specific in terms
        of any change in the thought process. as a regulator, what page 32 of 35 icici
        lombard general insurance co. ltd. january 17, 2025 as the environment improves,
        we should start seeing the leverage coming back. icici lombard general insurance
        co. ltd. january 17, 2025 they''re looking for is to make sure that the overall
        industry operates within a defined threshold. at this point of time, that
        number stands at about 30-35% as the case maybe. this has been just put into
        practice maybe since the last 1 year or so. so hence, to that extent, to expect
        anything suddenly changing, given even the change that they have put in the
        context of 1/n or thereabout, i think that''s something that''s not within
        our knowledge in terms of whether the regulator is looking for any specific
        changes to be made. so at this point of time, the limit of 30-35% stands intact.
        having said that, what we at least understand from the market is the regulator
        is obviously keeping a very close watch on making sure that the larger market
        players continue to make sure that they run their overall operations at an
        eom which is less than 30% or 35% as the case maybe. if you look at basis
        public disclosure of financial outcome, still there are a large number of
        players, who even on an fy2024 basis, have exceeded the threshold and clearly,
        from market, we understand that the regulator has asked each of these companies
        to come out with a plan of action, to make sure that they are able to come
        within the threshold. so that is where we are. we don''t think there is going
        to be anything immediate insofar as change in the expectations on meeting
        the limits or expense of management is concerned from a market perspective.
        to your second point on what are the business lines that invariably contributes
        to, let''s say, a high expense of management. again, multiple factors. so
        for example, the point that i made saying that if you make any investments
        in opportunities for the future, so that entails a cost, that will be a part
        of my expense of management numbers today. so that will increase the ratio.
        second, in terms of the mix of business that you write, which is what i explained
        earlier, if i''m writing, let''s say, a relatively new portfolio on the motor
        side, that invariably comes with maybe a low loss ratio, high expense. so
        page 33 of 35 ICICI Lombard General Insurance Co. Ltd. January 17, 2025

        that will result in higher expense numbers. Third will be, again, given

        the fact that we are driving a lot more of Retail Health, so that

        invariably comes with a slightly higher cost of acquisition. So multiple

        moving parts. And that''s the reason why I keep saying look at more

        on Combined as compared to just the expense ratio number. icici lombard general
        insurance co. ltd. january 17, 2025 that will result in higher expense numbers.
        third will be, again, given the fact that we are driving a lot more of retail
        health, so that invariably comes with a slightly higher cost of acquisition.
        so multiple moving parts. and that''s the reason why i keep saying look at

  Jayant Kharote:
    analyst_company: Jefferies
    dialogue:
    - dialogue: first question is on the competitive scenario. given that we are approaching
        the eom glide path last couple of quarters, how do you see it play out over
        the next year, and specifically the impact that is having on group health
        and fire and what would be our sort of stance in case it intensifies, going
        into the next, say 4 to 6 quarters? that's the first question. i'll come back
        with the second one.
      speaker: Jayant Kharote
    - dialogue: so jayant, clearly, our stand has been pretty clear on that. we continue
        to operate within the eom guidelines, and there is no reason under any circumstances,
        we would like to violate that. as and when we see intensity building up, we
        will choose to withdraw rather than participate in that business intensity.
        another point is that the regulator has taken certain actions. so, in terms
        of expecting companies which are not within the eom guidelines to fall in
        line with that, there is a possibility that it will get disciplined and will
        not crush in pricing. if you see business lines like ghi and some others,
        further going low, we would abstain rather than participate. so we have absolute
        clarity as a team to let go what is not making commercial sense for us.
      speaker: Sanjeev Mantri
    - dialogue: sir, do you see this playing out in the claims of your competition
        and by when do you expect some more rationality on the pricing in these products?
        any time line?
      speaker: Jayant Kharote
    - dialogue: 'see, we are no one to judge in terms of what everyone else will do.
        but that being said, we did speak about where fire went and where fire is
        expected to be. so anything which goes below our threshold, will tend to autocorrect
        itself as it''s not viable. it will play out. it''s not that it will not play
        out. but there''s a point of time when others will, and we respect that, we''d
        like to fall in line for eom, and manage this subsequently as and when things
        go apart. my sheer presumption is that each one of us who operates in the
        industry wants to run the page 23 of 35 ICICI Lombard General Insurance Co.
        Ltd. January 17, 2025

        business in a profitable manner, and a better sense will prevail over

        a period of time.'
      speaker: Sanjeev Mantri
    - dialogue: so second question is on ifrs. we know we've guided or at least indicated
        on some improvement on the combined ratio, but it's been almost 3, 4 quarters
        now, any more disclosures or anything that you would have gone back, and then
        can help us understand what could be the possible impact?
      speaker: Jayant Kharote
    - dialogue: so on ifrs, obviously, as and when the rules come in, we will fall
        in line, there is no question of we not falling in line. we've also spoken
        about the overall benefit it can have on account of discounting of reserving,
        and also deferred expenses coming into play. it will emanate in time to come.
        but one fundamental thing, which we all have to understand is that this is
        just mode of accounting, right? the economic value that gets driven, whether
        it's 1/n, whether it's ifrs, all of it is part of the process in which manner
        you will do the accounting of it. the business being sought, the long-term
        value that is to get treated, they all remain similar. you can project this
        number in multiple manner, it doesn't change how we want to operate. it's
        not that ifrs will change the manner in which we want to do business. we still
        would like to do what we are pursuing at this point of time. so there is excitement
        of that coming through, and we will be more than happy. in fact, we are very
        clear to say that by only large player, everybody in the industry should start
        publishing on ifrs basis.
      speaker: Sanjeev Mantri
  Madhukar Ladha:
    analyst_company: Nuvama Wealth Management
    dialogue:
    - dialogue: a couple of questions from me. first, i see a very sharp increase
        in commission cost. now can you explain what has led to that? and second is
        in the new 1/n, now that's the way we will be reporting numbers, so what should
        our guidance deal in terms of exit in q4 for combined ratio and also then
        what are we looking at for the next few years. so, yes, some help on that
        would be very useful.
      speaker: Madhukar Ladha
    - dialogue: 'so madhukar, i will always keep again urging all of you to look at
        numbers more on a combined ratio prescription, rather than even looking at
        breakdown of that combined into loss ratio, and let''s say, page 26 of 35
        icici lombard general insurance co. ltd. january 17, 2025 necessarily be the
        same as compared to a line of business, for example, in quarter 3, we also
        have contracts of other lines of businesses, where we don''t have a reinsurance
        arrangement, but there''s a cost of acquisition and by this very inherent
        nature of a transition to 1/n, the cost gets deferred. there is nothing in
        terms of income for us to defer over the policy period, leave aside the obligatory.
        that''s a very small component. so that''s the reason why you see an outcome
        for quarter 3 in terms of profits to be higher than what you would have normally
        reported on without 1/n approach. now this can change. going ahead, if let''s
        say, the proportion of mix of businesses undergo a change in terms of the
        various factors that i spoke, the outcome could be either reverse. you could
        possibly see a situation of neutrality in terms of no change in profits or
        equally, you could see maybe an outcome similar to what we are seeing for
        quarter 3 this year. so lot of moving parts. hence, to that extent, very difficult
        to attribute any specific reasons, but quarter 3, this is the reason. it has
        been more businesses which are long term are the ones where there are only
        cost of acquisitions to be amortized, but relatively, there are no reinsurance
        commissions to be done. icici lombard general insurance co. ltd. january 17,
        2025 maybe the expense ratio and within that, you are maybe asking the question
        which is more further breakdown on commission number corresponding to that.
        so given the nature of the business that we have, you will obviously see a
        mix of outcome. as i just mentioned, q3 in specific, i think you have seen
        on let''s say, for whatever corporate business that we used to write in the
        past, that particular part of the business has been muted and therefore, you
        will obviously see a relatively lower cost of acquisition, which otherwise
        would have been there, had that particular growth of commercial business been
        there in quarter 3. hence, the large part of quarter 3 are businesses which
        are fundamentally driven, so far as the retail line of opportunity is concerned.
        secondly, quarter 3, in general if you see, it''s a period of festive season.
        so when you put both of this together, you will obviously find an outcome
        in terms of, even in the context of just the commission numbers or let''s
        say, the commission ratio, you will obviously possibly see an increase therein.
        but at the end of the day, even as what sanjeev mentioned, i think for us,
        i think what is something that we are very conscious of, is to make sure that
        we run the overall operations at an expense of management which cannot exceed
        30%. so that''s a guardrail for us, is something that we are very conscious
        of. second and more importantly, i think for us, we will obviously keep looking
        for outcomes in the form of combined ratios on businesses. at the end of the
        day, we are all here to give at what we have put also in the opening remarks,
        which is a sustained return on capital for stakeholders. so that''s equally
        important. from an roe outcome, it’s something that, again, we are very conscious
        of. i think the range that we have spoken about is to be within that range
        of 16% to 18%. also, as things start to improve relative to the market, obviously,
        we would want to see that getting better as well. so those are guardrails
        within which we operate with. hence, i would again urge each of you to look
        at outcomes with some of these guardrails at the benchmark. page 27 of 35
        ICICI Lombard General Insurance Co. Ltd. January 17, 2025

        To your point on what would be the outcome on Quarter 4 Combined,

        and maybe, let''s say, as we get into the next financial year, I think

        Sanjeev already responded to that in response to one of the earlier

        questions. I think again, as we keep saying, let''s say, when we look

        at Quarter 4, two factors. One, we obviously have to wait and see

        how the environment plays. So, to that extent, that''s a variable.

        Second, we will have to see how the market responds. I think what

        we have said, our combined will, again, be in relation to the industry

        outcomes. At least the first half seems to indicate that the market is

        slightly more adverse, compared to 111%, it''s at about 113%. So

        we''ll wait and see how Quarter 3 numbers are for the other players

        in the market and corresponding to that is how our own Quarter 4

        outcomes will play out.

        But what we are conscious of, I think in all fairness, when we look at

        maybe just the return on equity to stakeholders, I think the broad

        comfort that we can give you is we should definitely end the year

        within that range of about 16% to 18%. As we head into the next

        year, the approach to writing risk will still remain the same, and then

        we will keep looking for profitable opportunities.'
      speaker: Gopal Balachandran
    - dialogue: 'i''ll give you a small perspective. so clearly, you''ll get a better
        understanding of what gopal also is talking about it. if you look at our last
        year number, even before that, commercial business for us was clearly doing
        a very good growth numbers and you know that commercial business overarchingly
        worked in a combined ratio which is far lower. so when we started working
        on the planning for this year itself, we had a belief that commercial line
        per se remains secular on the contribution, which is what gopal also alluded
        in this conversation. as things stand, it''s not commercial line which has
        grown, but the retail line of business which we''re talking about, also retail
        indemnity that was motor line of business which has given us growth. when
        the configuration changes, it''s pertinent to page 28 of 35 ICICI Lombard
        General Insurance Co. Ltd. January 17, 2025

        understand that the combined ratio will also change. But the overall

        value that we want to give the stakeholder may not get impacted at

        all. So the obsession with Combined ratio, I do understand from your

        angle. But how we look at businesses has to be understood in a far

        more comprehensive manner to give a particular level of targeted

        ROE. There will be changes. If we had stuck to the same plan, maybe

        we wouldn''t have done what is required on Retail, and still stuck to

        a low growing growth. So we would have done a much lesser top

        line as well as shown a better combined, but it would not have

        served the purpose.

        So the point that Gopal keeps making is, look at the business in a far

        more comprehensive manner. We will have to stay agile in terms of

        what opportunities get provided. While we do give guidance and we

        did speak about it, we don''t want to get ourselves tied down because

        we have had “X" combined number, we will let go an opportunity,

        which will serve us much better in long term. It''s an overarching

        thought which I want to put across and why we''ll have to also real

        time change our plans as the market forces us to react to it.'
      speaker: Sanjeev Mantri
  Nidhesh Jain:
    analyst_company: Investec
    dialogue:
    - dialogue: the first question is on this 1/n, has the impact been passed on to
        the distributor, are they also getting commission on a yearly basis? do you
        expect any impact on the business growth because of that?
      speaker: Nidhesh Jain
    - dialogue: the answer is yes. it's regulatory, and whatever needs to be done
        is done. so it will be also taken where the annuity commission payment will
        happen to the distributors. as far as growth is concerned, there is an overarching
        impact in terms of long-term product being sold. but internally, from our
        organization perspective, the economic value that comes in selling the long-term
        product stays intact. so we continue to pursue in the market selling long-term
        products. the accounting part of it will emanate as and when it happens. gopal?
      speaker: Sanjeev Mantri
    - dialogue: 'so nidhesh i think the only thing that i''ll just add to what sanjeev
        rightly said, i think this is the first quarter, and therefore, to that extent,
        the market practices will also see an evolution, in terms of some of these
        changes that gets paid out. so for example 6 years page 20 of 35 ICICI Lombard
        General Insurance Co. Ltd. January 17, 2025

        back, when the regulator has mandated third-party mandatory for 3

        years, 5 years, in between there were changes in terms of the

        product construct to get Motor line of business recognized on a 1/n

        prescription, similar to what you see for the rest of the lines as we

        speak today. So those practices, obviously, evolve over a period of

        time. Hence, we will obviously watch the market developments very,

        very closely. Obviously, the intent, when you look at it from a

        regulatory standpoint, I think is very positive, in the way they have

        wanted this particular change. Therefore, our practices will be very

        clear to make sure that we clearly meet regulatory expectations. But

        obviously, we will keep a very close watch on market development

        as well, and keep taking actions corresponding to that, yes.'
      speaker: Gopal Balachandran
    - dialogue: also, if i was a distributor, and if i am able to do a long-term health,
        there is no reason, because it is 1/n, that should go through a change. what
        you're not getting in 1 year on the front-end basis, you will get over 3 years.
        so there is annuity income, that will flow over a period of time. so there
        can be a short-term thought process. if you're not getting it, you may not
        want to pursue with it. hopefully, better sense will prevail, and they will
        also look at economic value, and go ahead and stay long term as always required.
      speaker: Sanjeev Mantri
    - dialogue: sure. second question is on the reinsurance, the retention ratio has
        increased quite materially this quarter to 82%. so is there any change in
        strategy with respect to reinsurance? or it is just the business mix?
      speaker: Nidhesh Jain
    - dialogue: 'so honestly, there is no change, nidhesh. so, if you ask us our reinsurance
        program typically gets decided at the beginning of the year, that is what
        we have mentioned earlier as well. again, purely it''s a function of what
        is the split between mix of corporate, mix of retail and within that, if you
        recollect in the past, we have spoken about, let''s say, in the context of
        health, for example. on health indemnity as a line of business, we have always
        operated without, in that sense, leave aside the obligatory, which is true
        for everyone page 21 of 35 ICICI Lombard General Insurance Co. Ltd. January
        17, 2025

        in the market. Rather than the obligatory reinsurance, we don''t have

        any other reinsurance requirements from a Health Indemnity

        standpoint.

        On Health Benefit as a category, not just again this year, across

        years, we have obviously operated on a reinsurance structure. If you

        recollect, particularly not just against this quarter, this year, in

        general, the Health Benefit segment has seen an impact on growth.

        Therefore, to that extent, that will obviously have an impact on the

        net retention numbers. So that''s one.

        Second, for whatever it is, even Quarter 3 does have an element of

        Corporate Business as well. It''s not that Corporate Business comes

        down to zero. There, the approach for us, again, if you look at it over

        a 9-month basis, we have been very selective. Largely, we have tried

        to hold on to maintaining market share in that particular category.

        Also, given the fact that, that particular business is slightly in that

        sense subdued, that again contributes to the overall retention

        numbers. But if you see the overall retention numbers, the way we

        look at it on a net premium to gross premium, I think at least if you

        look at it on a 9 month basis in the current year, if you look at it even

        with the 1/n impact, I think the retention number will be roughly at

        about 72%. I think that''s where we are. To answer your point, no

        change in the reinsurance strategy, nothing specific. It''s not a case

        where we had an element of reinsurance for the first 6 months or

        something, and suddenly we have decided to change our approach

        to reinsurance. No significant change therein. And the other aspect

        is the bulk of the reinsurance renewal conversations will now happen

        in Quarter 4 for the next financial year.'

  Nischint Chawathe:
    analyst_company: Kotak Institutional Equities
    dialogue:
    - dialogue: just a little bit of commentary on the motor side. we can see the
        loss ratios improving for you, both on a sequential and annual basis, and
        significant improvement very specifically on the third-party side. just if
        you could give some commentary in terms of what's happening over here, how
        is the competitive intensity? and i believe we have gained market share in
        this quarter in both the segments.
      speaker: Nischint Chawathe
    - dialogue: 'yes, so nischint, you''re right. clearly over the last few years
        if you would have seen, we have been slightly selective in the way we have
        been writing the risks, and that has stood with us in times of reflection
        on the combined outcomes. having said that, obviously, what we are seeing
        right now is renewed opportunities in the way we can write risks, and that''s
        reflective also in terms of the increase in the market share that we have
        seen relative to 9m fy2024. generally, if you see, i think we have been able
        to see, let''s say in this particular quarter, between new and renewal, largely
        the growth has been more or less similar when you look at a category level.
        and therefore, we continue to look for opportunities in each of private car,
        two-wheeler, cv. broadly, if you look at the mix, it''s in line with what
        we have normally seen over prior periods. on the loss experience, specifically
        nischint, this is something that we keep speaking about. obviously, when we
        write or maybe just select the portfolio, we have an ultimate loss experience
        that we go with an assumption at the time of writing the risk and over a period
        of time, given the fact that we have generally been prudent/conservative in
        our loss estimates, as the loss experiences starts to develop, you can see
        this not just for this year, across years, we have been able to see, let''s
        say, favorable loss development and that starts to get reflected on the numbers
        as we see across different financial periods. so that''s where we are. page
        12 of 35 ICICI Lombard General Insurance Co. Ltd. January 17, 2025

        But broadly, if you ask me, in terms of the overall loss ratio range that

        I have spoken about even in the past, and again, as I keep saying, it''s

        always better to look at motor as a category, rather than looking at

        own damage and third-party independently. The range that we have

        spoken about running overall motor in that range of 65% to 67%, I

        think that''s broadly the range that we believe we should continue to

        see as an outcome in terms of the portfolio experience. So that''s

        where we are.

        The positive news is, some of the market participants possibly who

        had gone quite aggressive in the past, you can clearly see most of

        those companies when you look at their individual month –on month

        growth numbers, clearly, there has been an element of calibration

        that has happened. That''s also reflective in the outcomes that these

        companies had to exhibit in some of their Combined ratio outcomes.

        So that''s where we are. We continue to be cautious in building the

        book and so far as the ethos on writing or selecting the portfolios

        continues to remain the same. As in, we will keep looking for on a

        sustained basis economic output, which we think will be viable from

        a longer-term perspective.'
      speaker: Gopal Balachandran
    - dialogue: absolutely. and also, just the thing is, in our mindset, we will do
        what makes sense to us. market share, of course, this year looks better, but
        we also had explained the market maybe almost 4 quarters back in terms of
        why our market share is where it is. so, it's more of an outcome of how multiple
        factors work. it's not something that we chase that this month we have to
        do this much only. it's more driven by outcome, and as and when it makes us
        look good, it's primarily driven by an ecosystem development, as we continue
        to pursue what we believe makes sense for us.
      speaker: Sanjeev Mantri
    - dialogue: and the delta this quarter or the much lower loss ratio in tp this
        quarter, could it be maybe because of better releases this quarter? page 13
        of 35 ICICI Lombard General Insurance Co. Ltd. January 17, 2025
      speaker: Nischint Chawathe
    - dialogue: so again, as we keep saying, nischint, tp, again, i've spoken in numerous
        occasions even in the past, right? given that, and all of you understand,
        you all have been tracking us pretty much for a very long period of time.
        and this is clearly a book, which is much more long tail in terms of loss
        development. loss experiences, obviously, have to be looked at over a period
        of time. also as i said, obviously, the level of prudence that we kind of
        go with, in terms of our reserving estimate, that's stands pretty much intact,
        absolutely no change in the philosophy of reserving. therefore, as the portfolio
        actually starts to experience outcomes, you could see, say, some of the releases
        play out at different periods. it could be in a particular quarter, it could
        be in a particular financial year. but on an overall basis, which is why if
        you look at our reserving triangle, now that you also have a specific triangle
        outcome in the context of third party as well. there again, you will see consistently
        for us, there are small amount of favorable loss development that we have
        seen over the years. this is, again, not just for one quarter or one year
        or two years. it's across financial periods that we have been able to see
        some small amount of favorable development. hence, to that extent, the approach
        to reserving will continue in terms of a favorable loss development. that's
        how we have been kind of going about risk selection, as i talked about.
      speaker: Gopal Balachandran
    - dialogue: and just finally, in this backdrop, do we really sort of now expect
        a third party tariff hike this year?
      speaker: Nischint Chawathe
    - dialogue: so, there nischint again, you know, well, industry is expecting it
        for last few years, and it's not something which we control. the answer to
        this is, yes, we do expect a hike, but can it come, can it not, is something
        which will come from the regulator as well as morth, the way tp price is decided.
        but we do believe, yes, it's been 3 to 4 years and there might be possibly
        a hike at least which we'll get for next financial year. page 14 of 35 ICICI

  Prayesh Jain:
    analyst_company: Motilal Oswal
    dialogue:
    - dialogue: just harping, gopal, on this point on the loss ratio on the motor
        side again. so you were mentioning that for the motor as a piece, we should
        be looking at a loss ratio of 65% to 67%, but we are way below that currently.
        so would you still say that the full year number would be in that range? or
        that's more of a longer-term loss ratio that you would be looking at? that's
        my first question. second is on the health loss ratio, could you give the
        granularity on how much was the retail health loss ratio and how much was
        the employer-employee loss ratio? also, just on the fire piece, you mentioned
        that there could be price hike, so why would that be, because your loss ratio
        outcomes seems to be pretty controlled at 50.1%? yes, that would be my questions.
      speaker: Prayesh Jain
    - dialogue: 'perfect, so maybe i''ll go in the reverse sequence. so let me start
        with the commercial lines. so again, prayesh, all of you understand that commercial
        lines in general is a relatively high exposure portfolio, therefore, to that
        extent, you can obviously see experiences, which could be relatively with
        low frequency, high severity outcomes. therefore again, in a given period,
        you can obviously see experiences on loss numbers, which could be significantly
        adverse or maybe, at the same time, in case you don''t have large number of
        catastrophic events, then what you normally expect as attritional losses is
        how the portfolio will develop. clearly, we have seen not just in the indian
        market, across the globe, we have clearly seen increased incidences of some
        of these catastrophic events impacting insurers, reinsurers, customers at
        large. therefore, clearly, when you look at the overall portfolio outcome
        from a market standpoint, it''s leading to an outcome, where page 15 of 35
        icici lombard general insurance co. ltd. january 17, 2025 icici lombard general
        insurance co. ltd. january 17, 2025 the experiences, from a reinsurance standpoint
        may not be necessarily in that sense viable at the level of pricing that they
        have given to the market at large. so hence, given the fact that some of these
        events are more frequent, more in numbers, there is obviously a need for the
        entire market across stakeholders to look at what should be the level of price
        that you should offer for risk selection. equally, in the past, for example,
        you would have seen very long periods of soft pricing as well. so that''s
        how the nature of the business is. you will obviously see through various
        price cycles. at sometimes, you will obviously, as i said, experience soft
        pricing. currently, the regime where maybe because of these increased incidences,
        you will see some bit of hardening in price. at least, which is where we are
        coming from. the expectation is at least so far as the quarter 4 and, more
        importantly, the april 1 renewals, which will largely be where bulk of the
        corporate renewals will happen. we do expect the overall market to be far
        more sensible so far as pricing those risks are concerned. so that''s where
        we are, and that''s what we believe from an overall positive sentiment. to
        your point on the health loss breakdown and what every quarter we keep asking
        for this split, on corporate health, which is the ghi segment, again, i''ll
        give the quarter 3 numbers for both the segments first, which is corporate
        health and retail indemnity. so for corporate health, q3 fy2024, that number
        was 93.1%, that number for q3 fy2025 is at 97.2%. and retail indemnity numbers
        last year was 66%, which is down to about 65%. on a 9 month basis, again,
        in the same sequence, corporate health last year 9m fy2024 was 95.8%, which
        is currently at about 97.7% in 9m fy2025. the retail indemnity numbers, which
        was 65.6% for 9m fy2024, that number stands at about 69.1% in 9m fy2025. but
        more than, let''s say, some of these numbers, in general, what we have seen
        is, pretty much, we do see maybe some continuation of page 16 of 35 ICICI
        Lombard General Insurance Co. Ltd. January 17, 2025

        increased incidences of claims playing out in the context of the

        Health segment specifically. Therefore, in line with what we have

        spoken even in quarter 1, we said we will obviously observe for the

        development of this increased incidences over the next few quarters.

        So that''s where we are and in that context is where the numbers are

        for the health loss numbers.

        To your last point on Motor, the range that we spoke about at 65%

        to 67%, you''re absolutely right. That''s obviously the preferred range

        at which we would want to run the book again, not just over a 1 or

        2 year horizon, that''s something that we would want to look at it

        over a much more long-term play. Having said that, obviously, now

        when it comes to specific financial periods, it could be purely a

        function of what mix of business that you write. Again, we have

        discussed this in the past, particularly when it comes to new motor,

        that typically comes with a relatively low loss outcome, but possibly

        a slightly higher cost of acquisition. But equally, on the fixed side,

        when you start to source more of the renewal or the older book, that

        invariably comes with a slightly higher loss outcome, but obviously a

        lower cost of acquisition. So that''s how we manage the overall

        portfolio in the way how we see the market opportunity. But over a

        medium to long term, the range that we are comfortable with to

        operate with will be between 65% to 67% for Motor as a category.'
      speaker: Gopal Balachandran
    - dialogue: any price hikes contemplating in the health segment?
      speaker: Prayesh Jain
    - dialogue: 'that''s something that we keep looking for, prayesh and we have not
        shied away from taking a price change. you would recollect again, slightly
        going back to some of our conversations even in the past, if you were to go
        back maybe almost 4 years back, q3 fy2021, at that point of time, we did effect
        an average price increase of roughly about 8% on the overall renewal book.
        and then roughly about 1.5 to 2 years thereafter, again, we had effected a
        price increase, which ranged anywhere between 20% to 22%. page 17 of 35 ICICI
        Lombard General Insurance Co. Ltd. January 17, 2025

        So, in general, I think, again, on the Retail Indemnity book specifically,

        you had spoken about the fact that the range that we are

        comfortable on running the book is a loss ratio of around that range

        between 65% to 70%, more towards, I would say, slightly on the

        higher end of the range. At this point of time, as you would have seen

        the outcome largely is playing out within the range that we are

        comfortable with. But having said that, if the portfolio warrants any

        price revision, we will not shy away from taking one.'
      speaker: Gopal Balachandran
  Rishi Jhunjhunwala:
    analyst_company: IIFL Institutional Equities
    dialogue:
    - dialogue: 'so just firstly, on the investment leverage, right, so if you look
        at it, it''s already down to 3.77x for us, and there has been a sharp decline
        in the last 6 months. this is despite the fact that i''m assuming that motor
        vehicle act-related benefits haven''t really completely played out as yet.
        so just wanted to understand your thoughts in terms of with or without that
        implementation on a pan-india basis, where do you see the investment leverage
        stable out or stabilize? a related question to that is 2 - 3 years ago, we
        had given up this 20% roe and 100% combined ratio target in order to ensure
        that we are not missing out on growth opportunities. given that we are now
        page 29 of 35 ICICI Lombard General Insurance Co. Ltd. January 17, 2025

        at 20% ROEs, and combined ratios are trending closer to 100%, I

        mean, we are still 200 bps away, do you think there could be a

        recalibration to that target in the medium term?'
      speaker: Rishi Jhunjhunwala
    - dialogue: 'so rishi, let me take again in the reverse sequence. so if you ask
        us, the narrative in terms of our intent to keep looking for profitable growth
        opportunities remains the same. so therefore, do we stand committed to staying
        within that return on equity objective? of course, that pretty much stays
        intact. that''s the range i talked about. in the medium term, given the level
        of combined, we should be getting to an outcome, which would be between 16
        -18%. the reason why i''m saying this is because you will still appreciate
        the fact that we don''t want to lose opportunities for investment in areas
        which will propel growth in the future. so that''s something that we are very
        conscious of. therefore, these investments, which we have been speaking to
        even in the past, will entail an upfronting of expense in the p&l. that by
        itself, when you look at it just from years'' outcome, it will possibly look
        at maybe an roe which may not be equal exactly to 20%, for that matter of
        fact. but these are investments, which we think is something that we should
        make at this point of time, the effect of which will play through maybe over
        the next 2 to 3 years. but if you ask us, again, the point that we keep saying,
        the economic objective in terms of what we want to write, clearly is within
        that range of roe objective that i responded in response to one of the earlier
        questions. same thought process on combined. the lens with which we look at
        each of the business opportunity, again, not just any particular line, across
        lines, i think the lens that we apply is obviously combined and equally, ultimately,
        the returns that would fetch to stakeholders for the capital that is being
        infused. page 30 of 35 icici lombard general insurance co. ltd. january 17,
        2025 at 20% roes, and combined ratios are trending closer to 100%, i mean,
        we are still 200 bps away, do you think there could be a recalibration to
        that target in the medium term? icici lombard general insurance co. ltd. january
        17, 2025 so obviously, both of this does not fundamentally changed, and we
        stand committed to the range that we have spoken through. but all of these
        have to be looked at in the context of how the market operates. hence, to
        that extent, this may be something that we will see playing out over long
        term, assuming the market starts responding sensibly. but at times, in case
        if the market responds more aggressively, in terms of competition, then to
        that extent, maybe some of these metrics will possibly get postponed by a
        year or two. so that''s where we are. on the first point, the investment leverage,
        i think, again if you look at the way the leverage gets computed, obviously,
        there is a numerator, which is the investment assets; and the denominator,
        which is net worth. then investment assets is obviously in the context of
        the various investments. some of these investments are carried at a market
        value, and these are point estimates at the point of time. as you would have
        seen, particularly since you''re looking at the numbers on a quarter 3 basis,
        for example, we have seen obviously particularly equity markets relatively
        exhibiting a slightly more subdued sentiment. in that context, if you look
        at maybe the mark-to-market position that you would have at the book as at
        september, relative to as of december, obviously, at a point of time, that
        number would have seen a decline. so that would have some impact when you
        look at the investment leverage. second, again, as what we have been speaking,
        there has also been a relative slowdown in growth, in general for us. that,
        by itself, clearly also contributes to the overall available cash flows, and
        that has also had an impact on the overall investment leverage. third, i think,
        again, clearly, particularly for some of the commercial lines, which generally
        is very profitable, that''s also been a segment where we have not seen as
        much of growth as what one would have expected. so all these factors is where
        we are on the leverage. but page 31 of 35 ICICI Lombard General Insurance
        Co. Ltd. January 17, 2025

        as the environment improves, we should start seeing the leverage

        coming back.'
      speaker: Gopal Balachandran
    - dialogue: also, just a small thing is that the motor vehicle act that you refer
        to, rishi, there's a faster intimation, then there will be a lower investment
        leverage, not higher. so that's one small thing. it's more driven by cash
        flow, and contribution in terms of the nature of business that comes through.
        ironically, as much i don't want to, but if you have a growth of pat also
        that bulges the denominator and net worth will go up, and that itself will
        lead to investment leverage going down. i mean it's more mathematical is what
        i'm saying, but multiple things will go in. it's, again, an outcome, we do
        understand the value of leverage in your mind. but we write business in terms
        of what makes sense, and this comes out as an outcome. it's not that we don't
        look at cash flow, but that is not the reason why we end up writing certain
        businesses or eliminate many businesses.
      speaker: Sanjeev Mantri
  Sanketh Godha:
    analyst_company: Avendus Spark
    dialogue:
    - dialogue: so, gopal, you said that you want to work motor tp and on motor od
        loss ratio in the range of 60 -65%. if i take at the other end for motor tp
        at 65%, is it fair to assume that in q4, the loss ratios in motor tp will
        be more 70-75%, compared to what you have reported 60.1% for 9m fy2025? so
        that's a fair assumption to make to remain conservative with respect to motor
        tp reserving?
      speaker: Sanketh Godha
    - dialogue: 'sanketh, just for the sake of reiterating, i will keep saying that
        i would always urge all of you to look at numbers more over long-term horizon,
        particularly for motor third-party. it would be in that sense, when i use
        this, to say that ideally quarters will have multiple factors to it. as i
        just mentioned, one factor would be in terms of the business mix that we see
        as an opportunity. so that by itself will determine what the loss ratio outcome
        could be. also, as i said, we keep looking for the outcome of the large development
        of the book that we have written the past. this is not just something that
        we do at a particular point, this is something that we keep evaluating every
        quarter. that would be true even for quarter 4. in case if in any of the past
        book reflects something better in terms of outcome, then obviously, to that
        extent, you will see some of the impact play out even in quarter 4 as well.
        hence, i think, rather than talking about a point estimate or a point number
        for a particular period, it''s better that we keep looking page 18 of 35 ICICI
        Lombard General Insurance Co. Ltd. January 17, 2025

        at, which is where I said, the medium to long-term range on Motor

        as a category. Again, this is something that all of you understand, it''s

        always, in that sense, given the fact that Motor own damage is free

        to price, Motor third-party is fixed and tariff. Better to look at motor

        as a category, rather than trying to even split between motor own

        damage and third-party. And hence, just to reiterate, medium to

        long-term range that we are comfortable on running the book will be

        between 65-67%.'
      speaker: Gopal Balachandran
    - dialogue: got it. and see you reported 102% on 1/n and 102.8% if you exclude
        1/n. so the management guidance was to end up with 102% for fy2025, and probably
        101.5% for the fourth quarter. so even factoring a bit of negative impact
        from 1/n, do you still continue to maintain that guidance to play out for
        the full year? also, if i take exit as 101.5% for the fourth quarter, should
        we fairly assume that is a number which will be there too for fy2026? the
        second thing is that if you can break down the exact growth of motor into
        new and old vehicle, the way you did it last time.
      speaker: Sanketh Godha
    - dialogue: yes. so maybe i think i will give you the numbers for new and old.
        this again, i'm giving you for quarter 3. so new was again, 9.5% which is
        what i just mentioned in response to one of the calls, largely the numbers
        were similar. 9.5% growth for new and almost a similar number of 9.3% for
        the old. so as a category, the overall growth was 9.4%.
      speaker: Gopal Balachandran
    - dialogue: 'okay and on the guidance part, sanketh that you spoke about, clearly,
        as we had put across as to where we want to finish the whole year, at that
        point of time, there was no visibility that 1/n will come and when such changes
        happen, the configuration of product which we procure from the market also
        can go through a transformation. there''s no reason to believe that, directionally,
        we are not there, but at the same time, we also have to evaluate what the
        opportunity comes through. so it''s a combination of all this page 19 of 35
        ICICI Lombard General Insurance Co. Ltd. January 17, 2025

        aspects that will decide the way forward. Its early days. This is the

        first quarter where the industry and we are giving numbers, which

        are on a 1/n basis, and the strange part is the configuration where

        the first 6 months are not on 1/n and this quarter is 1/n. So to that

        extent, it will play out over the course of time. The industry''s

        performance, which we spoke about, and I said, has moved to 113%,

        whereas it was 111%, so it''s relatively worsened. So all of these

        factors will also weigh in. But what we also stay committed, is

        besides Combined ratio the ROE range that we want to operate,

        which we spoke about it when we have met up. So it''s a combination

        of things, which will keep us excited in terms of doing selection also.'

        of only an increase in profits. because again, this will be a function of
        what business mix that you source, what is the reinsurance structures that
        you may have in practice, and what is the acquisition cost that you relate
        to, with respect to sourcing any of those businesses. so there are multiple
        factors which will drive, let''s say, an outcome when you look at it from
        a transition to a 1/n slash without a 1/n outcome. now talking specific in
        the context of quarter 3, i think obviously this has been a quarter where
        we were just talking about. in general, i think the credit-linked disbursement
        across financial institutions have clearly been muted. and obviously, to that
        extent, and we have been one of the key writers of some of those risks. that''s
        an area where i said, we have always been historically operating also with
        the reinsurance structure. the fact that the business growth has been relatively
        subdued, obviously, that does have an impact, both in terms of growth in premiums,
        and therefore, correspondingly the impact that it has. i mean when you look
        at it, 1/n, effectively, the prescription is to say that whatever acquisition
        costs that you incur, you defer it over the contract period. similarly, if
        there''s an element of reinsurance income that you may have, that is something,
        again, you defer it over the policy contract. so in a quarter, if you do see
        businesses where you already had an element of a reinsurance arrangement,
        and if that business gets subdued, and therefore, the relative impact in outcome
        will not page 25 of 35 ICICI Lombard General Insurance Co. Ltd. January 17,
        2025

        necessarily be the same as compared to a line of business, for

        example, in Quarter 3, we also have contracts of other lines of

        businesses, where we don''t have a reinsurance arrangement, but

        there''s a cost of acquisition and by this very inherent nature of a

        transition to 1/n, the cost gets deferred. There is nothing in terms of

        income for us to defer over the policy period, leave aside the

        obligatory. That''s a very small component. So that''s the reason why

        you see an outcome for Quarter 3 in terms of profits to be higher than

        what you would have normally reported on without 1/n approach.

        Now this can change. Going ahead, if let''s say, the proportion of mix

        of businesses undergo a change in terms of the various factors that

        I spoke, the outcome could be either reverse. You could possibly see

        a situation of neutrality in terms of no change in profits or equally,

        you could see maybe an outcome similar to what we are seeing for

        Quarter 3 this year. So lot of moving parts. Hence, to that extent, very

        difficult to attribute any specific reasons, but Quarter 3, this is the

        reason. It has been more businesses which are long term are the

        ones where there are only cost of acquisitions to be amortized, but

        relatively, there are no reinsurance commissions to be done.'

commentary:
- dialogue: 'thank you so much. good evening to each one of you. thank you for joining
    the earnings conference call of icici lombard for q3 and 9m fy2025. at the outset,
    let me wish you all a very happy new year. as i complete my first year in my current
    role, i am excited to share developments we have made together since we connected
    on january 16, 2024. we outlined our vision of “one il one team,” building cohesive
    teams to leverage synergies and complementary strengths to tap into new business
    opportunities. in this endeavor, we realigned our teams to work collaboratively
    under a unified product / business practice. today, i am pleased to share many
    of our initiatives such as one il one call centre, one il one digital, and one
    il one agency have started yielding results. any change of a significant magnitude
    requires continuous reinforcement, and we continue to learn as we co-create an
    environment conducive to growth, innovation and collaboration. let me now update
    you on industry trends and developments that we have witnessed in the past few
    months of fy2025. for the quarter ended september 2024, as per the data released
    by mospi1, the gdp2 growth slowed down to 5.4% as compared to 8.1% in the corresponding
    quarter of previous year. let me dwell on certain key data points during last
    quarter, which can have an impact on gi industry at large -  on the corporate
    side, the industries supporting infrastructure and construction like steel, cement
    and commercial vehicle sales witnessed muted growth as government spending towards
    capital expenditure remained sluggish, which is also reflecting the commercial
    lines of general insurance industry. 1 mospi – ministry of statistics and programme
    implementation 2 gdp – gross domestic product page 3 of 35 ICICI Lombard General
    Insurance Co. Ltd. January 17, 2025

     On the auto sector, the industry reported muted growth in

    Quarter 3 of 2025 as per SIAM3, with growth in private car at

    4.5%, growth in two-wheeler at 3%, and de-growth in CV at

    0.5%. The retail numbers as reported by FADA4 has seen

    improvement in the growth on account of uptick in rural demand

    with private car growing at 5.9%, two-wheeler at 12.4% and CV

    at 1.6%.

     Health Insurance continues to be the fastest growing and largest

    contributor of the industry on the GDPI mix, attracting significant

    investment across stakeholders.

     The bank credit growth also moderated to ~11% due to the

    slowdown in credit to NBFC 5 segment and unsecured loans. In

    addition, the MFI6 sector growth also got adversely impacted due

    to structural changes.

    Further as we move towards the next quarter, we believe infra based

    spending, lower insurance penetration, enhanced risk awareness in

    a conducive regulatory environment is expected to have a positive

    impact on the general insurance sector over medium to long term.

    Coming to the regulatory update, general insurers are mandated to

    recognize premium for long-term products on a 1/n basis, effective

    October 1, 2024. As an industry, new motor policies due to long-term

    TP were recognized on 1/n basis. Thus, there is no impact on this line

    of business. The premiums under long-term health and other line of

    business were recognized in the year of underwriting itself. This

    change has an impact on the reporting of health and other line of

    business for the industry in Q3 FY2025. However, this does not

    impact the economic value, so we continue to evaluate business

    opportunities which is expected to deliver sustained returns to

    stakeholders.

    Secondly, on solvency norms, the authority issued guidelines on

    inadmissibility of assets, which changes disallowance of receivables,

    primarily from net basis to gross basis. Due to this, there is a

    reduction of ~30 basis points in our solvency ratio as at December

    31, 2024. Consequently, our solvency ratio was 2.36x as at

    December 31, 2024, which is higher than the minimum regulatory

    requirement of 1.5x. Thus, this change does not impact our growth

    journey. The General Insurance Council has represented the matter

    to the Authority, emphasizing the significant implications of this

    change on the solvency positions for the industry players.

    Now coming to the industry growth, Gross Direct Premium Income

    (GDPI) has grown by 9.5% and 7.8% for Q3 FY2025 and 9M FY2025

    respectively as published by GI Council. Excluding Crop and Mass

    Health segments, the industry registered a growth of 5.7% and 9.1%

    for Q3 FY2025 and 9M FY2025 respectively.

    Speaking on the specific segments within the industry during the

    quarter -

     Under Motor insurance, the industry grew at 7.6% for Q3 FY2025.

    o The total number of vehicles sold as per SIAM data is

    approximately 3.1 million private cars, 15 million two-wheeler

    and 1.2 million CV’s for 9M FY2025.

     The Health segment during the quarter delivered double digit

    growth, within this, Group Health grew at 14.6% and Retail

    Health grew at 6.6% year on year in Q3 FY2025. Further,

    subdued credit disbursement by financial institutions has

    resulted in a slower growth of Health Benefit business.

    Page 5 of 35 ICICI Lombard General Insurance Co. Ltd. January 17, 2025

     The Commercial Line segment de-grew at 8.4%. Within this, the

    Fire segment continued to de-grow, registering a de-growth of

    22.0% on account of pricing pressure. We expect the pricing to

    improve in the Fire segment in the coming months.

    Now speaking of the underwriting performance for the industry, the

    Combined ratio for the industry worsened to 113.3% for H1 FY2025

    as against 111.9% for H1 FY2024, largely on account of increase in

    expense ratio.

    For the Motor business, the industry combined ratio worsened to

    124.8% in H1 FY2025, from 119.4% in H1 of FY2024.

    I will now speak about the Company''s performance across key

    business segments during Q3 FY2025:

    The Company’s GDPI for Q3 FY2025 registered a growth of 4.8%.

    With 1/n accounting norm, the Company registered de-growth of

    0.3% as against the industry growth of 9.5%, during the same period.

    Excluding Crop and Mass Health, the Company de-grew by 0.7% as

    compared to industry growth of 5.7%.

     In Commercial lines segment, we remained cautious due to

    continued pricing pressure, resulting in de-growth of 8.6%,

    however, we continue to maintain our market share in the

    segment. Further, we have maintained our leadership position in

    Liability and Marine Cargo segments.

     In Motor, we grew at 9.4% for Q3 FY2025 as against the industry

    growth of 7.6%. Our growth in this segment was driven by festive

    led auto sales as well as old book. During the quarter, we

    sustained a balanced portfolio with a mix of private car, two-

    wheeler and CV at 52.9%, 26.7% and 20.4% respectively.

    Page 6 of 35 ICICI Lombard General Insurance Co. Ltd. January 17, 2025

     Moving to the Health business, during the quarter, we grew at

    10.3% for Q3 FY2025 and with 1/n accounting norm, we de-grew

    at 4.6%.

    o Within Health, our Retail Health segment registered a growth

    at 44.3%. With 1/n accounting norm, the growth was at 19.1%

    as against industry growth of 6.6% during the same period.

    Resultantly, we gained market share in Retail Health,

    reaching 3.2% in Q3 FY2025.

    o As updated in our previous call, we continue to invest in

    product innovation and technology integration. This includes

    upgrades to Elevate, revamping our super top-up product -

    Activate Booster, and travel product – TripSecure+ during the

    quarter.

    o In the Group Health – Employer Employee segment, we

    continue to maintain cautious approach on account of

    competitive intensity resulting in muted growth at 1.1% in Q3

    FY2025. Our Group Others business grew at 1.8%, with 1/n

    accounting norm, the de-growth in this segment was at

    33.0% during the same period.

     We continue to harness our digital capabilities to enhance

    customer experience, leading to our customer facing digital

    business growth of 9.9%, constituting 7.4% of our overall GDPI.

     During the quarter, our IL TakeCare App has surpassed 13.2

    million user downloads registering a premium of ₹ 664.2 million

    for Q3 FY2025.

     Additionally, I would like to highlight efforts we have undertaken

    towards improving claims efficiencies across Retail line of

    business -

    Page 7 of 35 ICICI Lombard General Insurance Co. Ltd. January 17, 2025

    o Our Preferred Partner Network (PPN) serviced 73.6% of our

    Non-OEM claims in Q3 FY2025 as against 67.3% in Q3

    FY2024.

    o Our average claim settlement period on Retail line of business

    has seen improvement. It has improved from 6 days in

    FY2024 to 5 days in 9M FY2025 for Motor OD, and from 5

    days in FY2024 to 3 days in 9M FY2025 for Health.

    o Our initiative IL Sahayak, which was launched in April 2024,

    offered an on-ground claim support to over 65,000 customers

    across 2,500 hospital networks.

    o We continue to monitor our customer feedback through

    independent agencies in form of Net Promoter Score (NPS)

    study on a regular basis. Our NPS continues to be healthy at

    69 and 65 for H1 FY2025 for Health and Motor claims

    respectively, supported by customer trust.

     In one of the previous updates, we discussed the core

    business and technology transformation project- ‘Project

    Orion’. We initiated transformation journey of our Health

    business and have now achieved a critical milestone by

    rolling out our flagship retail indemnity product “Elevate”

    on our new core platform. Going forward, we expect a

    shorter period for the development of products on our new

    system, Artemis. We are excited to see this extending

    across our product categories under the Health business

    and beyond.

    We firmly believe Project Orion will be a key enabler of our vision of

    One IL One Team.

    As we conclude, we are positive and determined to achieve

    profitable outcomes led by our robust multi-product, multi-

    distribution strategy, focus on product innovation, data analytics,

    Page 8 of 35 ICICI Lombard General Insurance Co. Ltd. January 17, 2025

    and digital enhancements with our guiding force of the One IL One

    Team.
