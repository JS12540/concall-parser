        "dialogue": "thank you, deepak. good afternoon to all. i extend a warm welcome to each of you for joining us in our q3 and 9 months fy '25 earnings call of adani group's cement business. we continue to strengthen our position as a market leader in the cement industry. adani cement is getting stronger over time, focused on growth both organic and inorganic, along with emphasis on operational excellence, esg and safety parameters. to begin with, i would like to share some of the highlights before diving into the specifics. 200- megawatt solar power, the project in gujarat, khavda, has been commissioned in q3 fy '25. 631 million tons of new limestone reserves were secured by us in this quarter. with orient acquisition at advanced stage, the total capacity by q4 fy '25 to hit 104 million tons. we have commissioned 8 new ready-mix plants in q3 fy '25 thereby reaching a milestone of 100 ready- mix plants. the consolidated quarterly y-o-y performance, we achieved a revenue of inr 9,329 crores, driven by strong focus on micro market management strategy, expansion of dealer network, blended cements at 82%, increase in premium products as a percentage of trade sales volume by 400 bps to 26 percentage. page 2 of 20 Ambuja Cements Ltd., ACC Ltd. and Sanghi Industries Ltd.\nJanuary 29, 2025\nand 34% civil work has been completed. We expect completion by Q3 FY '26. These Kiln lines\nwill have 42-megawatt of waste heat recovery and provision for utilizing 30% AFR.\nFor the new 3-million-ton clinker line at Jodhpur, which is of Penna, 85% civil work has been\ncompleted and major equipment ordering done. We expect completion by Q3 FY '26. For new\nfacilities of 2.4 million ton grinding unit at Salai Banwa in UP, 50% civil work has been\ncompleted, and 47% delivery of major equipment has been received at the site. We expect\ncompletion by Q1 FY '26.\nMajor equipment ordering for roller press at Bathinda grinding unit, fly ash grinding and\nblending system at Kalamboli and grinding unit at Dahej in Gujarat has been completed and all\nthe 3 projects are under execution. Contracts awarded for grinding unit at Marwar Mundwa in\nRajasthan and Warsaliganj in Bihar to EPC vendor, and both projects are also under active\nexecution.\nNow I shift my focus to share some of the key initiatives being undertaken for becoming a cost\nleader in the cement industry. Securing major raw material at cost competitive prices and\nefficiency and productivity improvement capex will help further reduce cost by 8% to 10%.\nFirst, let me discuss the steps we have taken to lower our energy costs. Our waste heat recovery\ncapacity at the time of takeover was 40 megawatts which we are now targeting to increase to\n218 megawatts by March '25. Currently, the WHS capacity is at 197 megawatts. We had earlier\nannounced our investment in 1,000 megawatts RE, which is expected to get commissioned by\nFY '26. On this account, 200-megawatt solar power at Khavda in Gujarat has been commissioned\nin Q3.\nBoth WHRS and solar power would ensure that 60% of our power requirements are -- of the\nplanned 140 million tons would be through green power. However, on clinkerisation, the share\nof green power will further rise to 83%. This would help in reducing the power cost by around\nINR100 per ton by FY '28.\nAs previously explained, to meet our requirements, we aim to have captive coal mines. As a\nresult, we are bidding for coal mines in the auctions being conducted by the government. A\nhigher share of coal from captive mines and the opportunity to buy imported pet coke will further\nlower our fuel cost.\nDriven by better fuel management and structural initiatives, our power and fuel costs have\ndecreased 7% to INR1,262 per ton in Q3 FY '25 from INR1,355 per ton in Q3 last year. These\ninitiatives include better fuel mix and increase in share of green power. The share of green power\nin power mix has increased to 21.5% from 15.8%.\nThe second cost item is freight and forwarding."
