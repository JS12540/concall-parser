                "dialogue": "a couple of points, amit, so that it will also pre-empt for other questions as well. see, when we compare y-on-y, this is like first full-fledged quarter which will have sanghi, penna, asian and tuticorin assets. so, like if you compare, say, december '23 versus december '24, december '23, sanghi was just consolidated for hardly 15-20 days of operation because in december\u201923, we achieved the closing of sanghi. and even for the september\u201924 quarter, penna was only for partial period of the quarter, when we acquired in somewhere, 16th of august, it got effectively consolidated. so only 1.5 months was there for september\u201924 quarter. so, q-on-q or y-on-y, whatever you take, this is the first page 7 of 20 Ambuja Cements Ltd., ACC Ltd. and Sanghi Industries Ltd.\nJanuary 29, 2025\nquarter where all these 4 acquisitions, Sanghi, Penna, Asian and Tuticorin, are getting\nconsolidated. Therefore -- you will compare it with this background as well.\nSecond point, while I don't understand like in terms of how people would look at it, but\nincentives are very much part and parcel of this business. And with every investment which is\nbeing made is entitled for incentives. Even as we speak, for example, like as an Ambuja consol,\nwe are sitting on a larger incentive bucket of almost INR4,500 crores to be received in due\ncourse.\nAnd even the earlier incentives, which have been in arrears, which will be received. Therefore,\nif you see even September, there has been an income of incentive for the past period. And\nlikewise, the good thing is that at least these cash flows are now coming back to the balance\nsheet, which were lying somewhere, the working capital was getting blocked.\nSo therefore, given the legacies of these companies, good thing is the business is able to resolve\nmany of these cases because the next question will also come in terms of the direct taxation\nwhere we have also added some of the provisions back and on -- both on the direct tax and the\nindirect tax, lots of efforts are going on to basically set the disputes and resolve them and bring\nthe money back into the balance sheet. So, incentives plays an extremely important role in the\noverall business."

But I'm very\nconfident that with all these repairs and maintenance, which was very much needed, I think by\nMarch end, these assets should start delivering almost 80%, 85% utilization. So, there is no issue\non evacuation. There's purely issue on maintenance, and that's also some of the money which\nhas gone in this quarter in our shutdown expenses.\nAnd Penna, I like to mention what my colleague, Vinod, just mentioned, the clinker utilization\nof Penna is as high as 78% already. However, the cement utilization is sub-40%, which it takes\ntime to ramp up because, mind you, both Sanghi and Penna, we have transited to Ambuja and\nACC brands, which are obviously selling in category A versus the previous brands, which were\nselling in category B and C.\nSo obviously, that needs substantial investments in the market. We are also putting more troops\non the ground, so that needs more hiring in the front-line sales and then brand and distribution\ninvestments."

The moment I bring in\n10%, 15% or 20% alternate fuels, which the cost is less than INR1 versus traditional fuel of\nINR1.60, INR1.70 in that part of the country, you can see a substantial savings coming out of\nthere. So, I think Penna plants and Sanghi -- Sanghi, in fact, I believe in time to come, will be\none of our lowest cost operations."

And of course, volume, we will again see a very high-volume growth in fourth quarter.\nBut if again, our realization per ton decreases, at least it should stabilize or be higher because\nwe should again take benefit of the north and the central region if the southeast remains\ndepressed.

                "speaker": "Ajay Kapur",
                "dialogue": "so, ritesh, i would answer it in a little different way. today, india is -- i think by the time we finish this current financial year, we will hit more like 450 million, 460 million demand and maybe closer to 700 million total capacities, of which the capacity which can produce cement would be 100 million tons lower. now if india grows at about 8%, so 8% on 450 million or 500 million is close to 30 million tons, which basically means you need to add 2.5 million tons additional volume either from the existing, the base or add new capacity. i think at 300 per capita, india being the second largest market, gdp still sub $3,000, inching towards $5,000 in the next couple of years. all this will translate into more housing demand, more infra demand, which is largely led by government. and i think the commercial demand about 15%, all of them will have their own growth trajectory. the question is if the industry does not responsibly add new capacity today, which is totally private sector investments today and totally based on free competition, consumers will end up paying prices which will be much, much higher. so, i think it's in the interest of the nation that you build cement at a lower cost, you are able to produce cement at a lower cost. and the companies which are able to command brand premiums like the ones fortunate for me to run, ambuja, acc, which are top end, which command at least inr30 to inr40 premium over the category b, c players, i think this is a good place to be in. there will be times when demand supply does not match. unfortunately, current year h1, the demand after growing a very healthy 7%, 8% for the first time went almost flattish. and that, alongside the new capacity creation, created a short-term sentiment pressure, which i believe will get adjusted because nobody will be able to manage the investments without requisite returns. and i think that's why the price situations will remain better in time to come."

Will we be on the left-hand side of the cost curve\ngiven the initiatives that we are taking, which puts possibly us on the pole position?\nAnd secondly, if one had to marry that with the lease expiries come 2030, how is Ambuja, ACC\nplaced versus the rest of the industry?
