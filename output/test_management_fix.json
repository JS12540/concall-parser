        "Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for taking time to join this earnings call. I\ntrust all of you have received our earnings documents, which we shared yesterday.\nWe are pleased to report the strong performance in the Q3 FY25. Our results reflect\nan all-round growth with all 3 business segments reporting mid-teen revenue growth.\nThis has been accompanied by clear progress across key operating metrics, and a\nsharp rise in profitability. While we continue our strategy to focus on volume growth,\nwe have strengthened our focus on high-end specialties, such as Cardiac Sciences,\nOncology, Neurosciences, which augurs well for our overall revenue intensity as well\nas growth in margin profile for the future.\nOur efforts to provide tailored solutions to diverse patient needs has enabled us to\ncreate value across all segments. We have been consistently investing in medical\nTranscript of AHEL Q3 FY25 Earnings Call Page 1 of 17",
        "With regards to the hospital expansion, we are on track to open 3 facilities in FY25,\n'26, second half. By the end of FY26, we will open Gurgaon and Hyderabad. We do\nbelieve that in all of these facilities, we will achieve breakeven very quickly, because\nwe already have an existing presence and brand Apollo is well known.",
        "Yes, sure.",
        "But having said that, we're also looking at different markets to support growth, among\nthem are Indonesia, Iraq, Iran, Sri Lanka. And I believe the flow of patients has started\nto come from these markets and the Middle East and Africa.",
        "No. So, for the current period, we're at 24.1%. I think moving on next year, we should\nonly be able to improve our margin. When we open these hospitals, because of the\ncalibrated opening of operating beds, I think the margin impact will not be more than\n100 basis points. So, net-net, we should be at around 24%.",
        "So, while there are headwinds from Bangladesh, I think we have to remember that\nApollo fortunately is present in many markets. And this gives us access to different\ncatchments. Currently, we are at 68%, but we are hopeful that we should improve to\n72%, 73% before the new beds open out. And by then, we would have found some\nlevel of replacement for the Bangladesh revenues and volumes, in terms of other\nforeign markets. Madhu?",

Our comprehensive and integrated healthcare offerings, marked by a\nrobust pipeline of initiatives and calibrated expansion plan, continue to strengthen our\nleadership position.\nWe are excited about the progress we are making in HealthCo with sustainable and\nhigh-quality growth in revenue, accompanied by margin expansion. The Keimed\nmerger is advancing well, and the team is on track to achieve breakeven in the digital\nsegment too within the next quarters. With a strategic focus on driving revenue\ngrowth, enhancing profitability and advancing operational excellence, we remain well\npositioned to deliver exceptional value.\nWe sincerely appreciate your continued interest and support and look forward to\nsharing our progress with you in the coming quarters.

        "Good set of numbers across our businesses. Broadly, I had 3 questions. Firstly, on\n24/7, now we are also adding insurance to the platform. So, what kind of a GMV\ngrowth are we expecting? Secondly, on the hospital, it's a busy FY26 for us. If you\ncould talk a little bit about how is the commissioning scheduled, which quarter should\nwe expect what? And lastly, just on the Microsoft partnership that we've announced.\nEarlier also, we had a partnership on the Cardio side. It seems the scope of this\npartnership is wider. Which parts of the business do we expect benefits or positives\nto be seen first?",
        "And any commentary on the outlook on future revenue growth or GMV growth for this\nsegment?",
        "For overall, 24/7.",
        "Okay, thanks team."

        "So, thank you for the question. We are a bit early at this point of time as far as our\ninsurance foray is concerned. We\u2019ve got all the necessary approvals from IRDAI, such\nas the entire corporate agency license, and certain other securities/digital clearances.\nAs of now, our GMV is around INR 3.5 crore for the full quarter, because we have\nbeen focusing purely as a marketing setup, and the product is only group health\ninsurance. In this quarter, we will be having at least 3 life insurance companies and 3\nhealth insurance companies, which will get enabled on our Apollo 24/7 platform. And\nfrom April 1 onwards, we expect the numbers to start building up. So, the number of\nTranscript of AHEL Q3 FY25 Earnings Call Page 3 of 17",
        "For the insurance alone?",
        "Okay, so, I might as well handle it right now. So, if you remember our last 2 quarters'\narticulation, our emphasis has been on trying to get a good quality of business. What\nI meant by that, and this is primarily from the Pharmacy side, e-Pharmacy side, we\nwere always dependent on a very marketing spend driven kind of a growth, which\nwas coming from digital marketing. However, the digital engines are extremely\nstringent in terms of remarketing abilities, thereby making the cost of acquisition for a\ncustomer for Pharmacy, very highly prohibitive. So, over the last 2 quarters, we\nchanged our operating model and as we speak now, our emphasis is on actually\nacquiring customers who will be with us for a longer period of time, examples, chronic,\nmoms and babies, where we get much stronger recurring revenue. That's what I mean\nby quality of the business, number one.\nNumber two, there is a much larger synergy between the Offline business and the\nOnline business, which is resulting in much lower cost of acquisition. We call it the\nomni business. Over the last 2 quarters, we have seen the traction going up. So, on\none hand, our paid marketing has come down. Other hand, our omni customer is\nslowly building up.\nThird, the Circle program, which I spoke to you in Q1, at the end of Q1 report, is really\nbeaming up pretty strongly. On the offline, the trajectory rate is very high. We have\nalmost 5 million customers who are paid for a Circle Loyalty Program, and they are\nbringing. Our next challenge is to how do we bring them on to the online platform and\nthat we are seeing happening in a good way.\nFrom a predictability perspective, we exited the month of December at INR 120 crore.\nWe believe that around INR 140 crore on e-Pharmacy would be our new normal at\nleast going forward, and we intend to build it. But again, I told you, I don't think we will\nbe looking at extraordinary growth. It would be much more sustainable growth with\nmargin, because our profitability by the end of Q2 and Q3 is what is our primary focus.\nOn the other 2 businesses, again, for consulting business, for example, it's shown a\nvery nice revenue trend. More than the GMV, we are getting a much positive revenue\nplay. We hope to sustain it. Maybe in the month of March, post our annual operating\nplans, we will be able to share with you much greater numbers.\nTranscript of AHEL Q3 FY25 Earnings Call Page 4 of 17",
        "Yes, thank you for the question. So, we will operate on both levels, but I would request\nall of you to bear with us for one more quarter. By the end of Q3, our recalibrated\nmodel of what is a right kind of cost structure for the next 2 years would be more or\nless ready. Ideally, we would have been ready to give you an answer right now, but\nthe 19-minute proposition that we did, in Q2 we started off; Q3, we have rolled it out\nto 4 cities. Effectively, this has pushed back our unit economics breakeven by maybe\naround a quarter. But it is actually resulting in reasonably good demand. We are able\nto get some new customers in these markets. We just need to get our unit economics\nright. As far as discount story is concerned, I think we have also recalibrated it to a\nreasonably good number, which I think is sustainable. Maybe another 50 basis points\nis something which we\u2019ll keep working on. So, we expect the numbers to start slowly\nmoving up. From April onwards, you will see growth coming in. Cost, there is a little\nbit more of some rationalization that we will end up doing. And like we always stated,\nby end of Q2 of the next year or positively in Q3, we will be able to break even on the\ndigital side. And if the insurance scales up much faster than we anticipated, maybe\nwe'll be able to give you a positive surprise. So, growth will come back. But I would\nsay maybe this quarter, you will see Q4 of this year slowly building up. But again, let\nme also highlight it will not be on par with the quick commerce kind of growth. We will\nbe much more sedate, but consistent and it will be profitable and sustainable growth.",
        "Between INR 900 crore to INR 1,000 crore all put together. A big chunk will still come\nfrom e-Pharmacy. We expect e-Pharmacy to validate at around INR 180-odd crore,\nand between the hospital consult business and Diagnostics and insurance, I would\nsay around INR 900 crore to INR 1,000 crore, give or take, INR 100 crore depending\nupon how we are able to manage our cost structure. So, we are already at INR 760\ncrore, INR 780 crore, we will slowly inch forward.",
        "No, I would say don't look at it from that perspective. We are committed to deliver it\nlike I said, either end of Q2 or Q3 of the coming financial year will be a positive, for\nwhich I need to have around INR 170-odd crore in Pharmacy into 3, so around INR\n900 crore Pharmacy plus Diagnostics plus consult put together. By that time, we will\nhave insurance also contributing, not necessarily from a GMV perspective, but more\non the margin side. So, our revenue side of the story will play out. So, I would still say\nyou can take around INR 900 crore, INR 950 crore as my primary GMV number, if\nthat is what the benchmark that you want to drive.",
        "Now, that's a very good question, thank you for asking. So, see, while insurance will\nstart off as primarily a margin expander, because we have a very strong base, we\nhave a reasonably good understanding of the medical records. So, unlike other\npeople, we are not going to be pushing insurance. Our intent is to give the right\nproduct to the right people. We will start off with that. That's what I meant by saying 3\nlife insurance companies and 3 health insurance companies with standard products.\nBut by the end of maybe Q1 of next financial year, we intend to get into OPD, which\nwill actually be very much in synergy, both with our e-Pharmacy business as well as\nour e-consult business, because then this will not only be creating a base, which helps\nus to build a margin structure on the insurance product, but also acts as a consistent\ndemand generator for our Pharmacy. We have experimented this with 1 or 2\ncorporates, and we believe. So, that's the first value-add is that.\nThe second value-addition that we have been building is what we call as the \u2018My\nFamily Doctor\u2019, which is a bunch of general practitioners between the Hospital, the\nClinic and Apollo 24/7. We offer some very base level services, so that we can then\nrefer it back to the hospital. So, these 2 engines will be value-added. So, we won't\nremain as primarily an e-commerce platform, which is focused on GMV, but exploring\na full comprehensive health care and insurance we\u2019ll be able to support.\nWe are also looking at a few partnerships with financial services institutions like SBI,\nICICI, etc. which will help us to get a much larger base of customers without actually\nincurring a huge cost. So, we have had some very good traction in this quarter, and\nTranscript of AHEL Q3 FY25 Earnings Call Page 7 of 17",
        "What we are realizing is the difference, the online proposition for Pharmacy, given the\nfact that the overall market is very much driven by discounts. One path is to walk the\ndiscount track which impacts your unit economics in a very negative way. But one\nway is to stick to our core Circle program, and work with banks and work with\ninsurance companies to find out whether they would be able to offer additional\ndiscounts or additional value propositions, which enables them to bring their\ncustomers to our platform. This is what I meant.\nFrom an earlier contribution of such discount level partnerships or scheme level\npartners, which used to be the range of around 2% to 3% of our contribution, has\nactually moved up to 13%, and we believe this will even pick up further. So, for\nexample, we are working on a co-branded card with SBI Cards. This will be a big base\nfor us, very similar to the Amazon ICICI Card Program. Think of a health card, this is\ngoing to be called a Health Card, which will dramatically help both our offline\nPharmacy business as well as online, and we'll have spillover benefits on to our both\nDiagnostics and hospitals as we make the proposition stronger. So, these are the kind\nof propositions, not simple corporate partnerships alone.",
        "On the Digital, our aspiration is to grow at an average of 20 plus kind of growth rate.\nLet me tell you how we intend to do it. Today, most of the businesses that we are\ndoing is primarily coming from the top 6 cities in our country, which is the top 6 metros,\nthat's almost 80%, 85% of our business comes from this. So, the reason why we are\ntrying to get our core model in place is to see how we can replicate it in maybe smaller\nmarkets. So, these are the cities. So, over the next 2 years, we intend to move that 6\nto at least around 25-odd markets. And I say 25 really core businesses. That's one\nway of looking at it, which would result in a 20% kind of a growth.\nThe other way is, today, we contribute around 15% of the Pharmacy business, which\nis the Offline Pharmacy, roughly around 15% of the overall Pharmacy business. In\nthe cities that we operate in, we are almost 30%. And as the trend grows more\ntowards Digital, we will build it up. So, this story will play out again in the remaining\n20 odd markets that we speak about.\nOn the e-consult business at the hospital, we are in the range of around 12% to 15%\nof the total consultation bookings that happen. We intend to build that up and become\na much more integrated partner with the hospital and with the Clinics.\nTranscript of AHEL Q3 FY25 Earnings Call Page 10 of 17",
        "We have already got the license, like I told you. We got it in the last month, but there\nare other regulations which we have to clear. So, we have got that also. So, we will\nbe rolling out a product in the month of March to begin with. And like I said, by April,\nwe will have at least 3 Life Insurance, and 3 Health Insurance businesses up in place.",
        "When we started the financial year, we were exploring how to touch around INR 4,000\ncrore. As we speak from Q2 onwards, like I said, we had a major recalibration in the\nway we are approaching the business. Instead of GMV, our focus shifted to ensuring\nthat we are able to build EBITDA-neutral model by Q3 coming financial years. So, we\nhave given ourselves 5 quarters. So, we are on goal. So, let me just explain to you\nthe GMV concept. So, GMV is a contribution of 3 lines of business, as we speak.\nTranscript of AHEL Q3 FY25 Earnings Call Page 13 of 17",
        "So, thank you for the question, sir. So, first and foremost, I completely agree with you\nthat in the digital e-commerce business, it's a very deep investment business where\nyou are putting in a lot of money, and therefore, there are a lot of startups, which are\nnot making money. And that's what we said over the last 2 quarters, we have\nrecalibrated the model, so that we don't have to go for growth at any cost, especially\nat the cost of the bottom line. So, we are very much on trajectory when it comes to\nbuilding the EBITDA profitability. So, as we have told again and again, over the next\n3 quarters, we should at least be into a breakeven model and build on model going\nforward. Number one.\nTranscript of AHEL Q3 FY25 Earnings Call Page 14 of 17",
        "So, we'll take all your suggestions on board, sir. We will work on this very closely.\nThank you.",
        "We will certainly consider. Thank you.",
        "There was this interest from mutual funds and also one-off interest, which we received\nfrom an income tax refund of almost around INR 20 crore. That was the reason.",
        "That's how it should be, yes."

    "Madhu Sasidhar": [
        "And I think the third question was about Microsoft partnership. I can take it if you want\nme to?",
        "So, the question regarding Microsoft, compared to the previous partnership, which\nwas narrow, on cardiac risk prediction. This, as you pointed out, is a much more\nbroader partnership. It aims to bring technology, some of the newest technologies in\nAI, to the bedside. And it's both an efficacy and an efficiency thing. There will be a\nslight improvement in efficacy due to clinical decision support, better accuracy, better\npatient quality, but we also expect a substantial improvement in physician and\ncaregiver productivity as part of these technologies.",
        "Yes. So, absolutely, and I think some of that answer was implicit in what A. K. just\ntold you as well. So, we see more capacity in our Chennai cluster. We see that some\nof the synergies between the units and between our group companies can build this\noccupancy potential. We will also replicate what we have done in some of the other\nmarkets, including the AP, Telangana market, which is to continuously drive our case\nmix towards a more complex cases that require multidisciplinary care. As you know,\nsome of the most complex care in the country is offered through our Chennai units.\nSo, we believe this is an opportunity for us to continue to expand with higher care\ncontracts.",
        "Yes. So, I think to add to what Ms. Suneeta said, I would say broadly that occupancy\nis probably not a perfect metric to measure us by, because there are so many\nnumbers that go into it. For example, especially in our top 6 units, where we have a\nsignificant occupancy and a bed constraint issue, we worked very hard to drive down\nthe length of stay. So, the right metric is inpatient volume. And as we've stated before,\nwhile the volume overall has grown up by 5.4%, CONGO volume is up by 10.3%.\nAnd even though we are doing more complex cases, we've actually, as a group,\ndriven down our length of stay from 3.34 to 3.29, and this is very intentional on our\npart. A lot of this is the operational efficiency that Ms. Suneeta talked about. Some of\nthis is enabled by Health IT. So, we'll continue to work on our efficiency, so that we\noperate in the right level of occupancy to make us efficient and for patient experience."

        "Just a little bit on the Hospital business. If I were to look at the cluster-wise data, there\nseems to be a fair bit of moderation or muted trends in both the Tamil Nadu cluster\nas well as the West cluster. I just wanted to understand the reason for the weaker\ninpatient volume growth in these 2 clusters.",
        "Understood. And in terms of the Chennai and Tamil Nadu cluster, given that it's a\nfairly high-margin cluster for us, how do we plan to replace this volume loss or lower\ninpatient flow, particularly given we don't know when that situation is going to\nnormalize. In the past, we had talked about corporate tie-ups, etc. when we added\ncapacity in Chennai. So, is there more room for us to tap into those to improve\noccupancy in the Tamil Nadu, Chennai cluster?",
        "Understood. My second question is on 24/7. You've talked about the collaborated\ngrowth and margin strategy for a few quarters now. At what point do we actually\nachieve the balance? I mean, at some point of time, shouldn't we start expecting the\ncost to go up as we are focusing on growth from these new areas? Is there more\nroom for us to actually cut costs to achieve that breakeven, or we need to see the\nGMV growth and the revenue momentum improve for that to happen?",
        "And sir, at what level of GMV are we talking about achieving that breakeven in the\nend of second quarter. In your view, what's that number, that would...\nTranscript of AHEL Q3 FY25 Earnings Call Page 6 of 17",

        "So, in Chennai, one of the important things that you should remember is this\nBangladesh effect, right. We have said that as an overall, as a Company, we have\nseen a 1.5% revenue impact because of Bangladesh. And most of Bangladesh was\ncoming into Chennai and Tamil Nadu. So, which is why if you look at it, at the Chennai\nlevel, it's almost a 3-plus % impact, which is there, and which is showing up in that\nregion that you're seeing. Otherwise, if you look at the revenue intensity in Tamil\nNadu, it has actually done much better, which is why if you look at Oncology, we have\ngrown very well in Oncology. Proton has done well. Transplants is picking up well.\nSo, some of the high-end CONGO specialties has really helped us achieve higher\nrevenue, right, at 8% compared to the volume. Volume would have again been 3-plus\n% at least had Bangladesh been better.\nOn the Western cluster, again, we did some moderation in the Ahmedabad region,\nwe had some moderation of CGHS cases that we were earlier doing, which is the\nreason that that's part of the Western region. But going forward, we are seeing a very\ngood uptake happening in Navi Mumbai. And we are hoping that into next year, we\nshould see Navi Mumbai doing much better than what we have seen this year.\nThis year, we have actually done very well, as you have seen in AP, Telangana, which\nis again something that we wanted to focus on, and that's the benefit that we are\nseeing coming into the existing cluster, which we told, if you remember last 2 years,\nwe have been telling you that we are first pruning some of the other cases and then\nhopefully, some of the paying cases will ramp up and which you have seen us do,\nwhich is the exact plan that we have for Western region.\nTranscript of AHEL Q3 FY25 Earnings Call Page 5 of 17",
        "Yes, Shyam, I think that's correct. You should consider it to be around 6% to 7%. I\nthink that's a fair number to consider going forward.",
        "At a broad level, you can expect 50% of it to come into next year and other 50% to\ncome into FY27. So, we would start as we said, that Pune and Calcutta and Delhi,\nDelhi which is the cancer hospital, those 3 will start first, followed by Gurugram and\nHyderabad. And broadly, you should expect 50% to come in next year, and 50% in\nthe year after that.",
        "Some of that, we have started building in anticipation of some of these beds. Like if\nyou look at Hyderabad, in Delhi, we have been adding some doctors, etc., because\nsome of these we should be able to leverage them even into the new hospitals.",
        "Let us come back to you on this. Allow us to come back, because there is time, and\nwe are clearly looking at mid-teen growth to continue, hopefully, even now. That's the\nmomentum that we are working on, and the new hospitals should add on. Let us come\nback to you on that separately.",
        "Yes, which is what we said. If you look at the Pune, the first one, which is there in the\npresentation, Pune, this should come in the first half. Calcutta should again come in\nthe first half. Hyderabad will come more closer to the end of the year. Gurugram,\nagain, closer to the end of the year. And Malleswaram and Mysore, we are still\nworking on the dates. We have not yet given you the numbers, days or when it will\ncome on. And Defense Colony, Delhi will come early into next year. That's the cancer\nhospital.",
        "So, half of this, as we said, operationally, this will come in '26, and then other will be\nin '27. All of these have large revenue potentials, right. If you look at it, Gurugram,\nHyderabad, Calcutta, Pune, all of them have large revenue potentials. The others will\ntake 3 to 4 years as we have said, because we have started work in OMR. We have\njust about to start work in Worli in the next 3 months. So, from the time we start work\nin Worli and all, it will take at least 3 years. So, you should look at next 3 to 4 years\nas we have said for commissioning all of the others.",
        "That's correct.",
        "No, not so much. It has got the pre-op expenses in that, but...",
        "So, I think all of them have seen more than double-digit growth, as we said, even in\nthe overall volumes. So, the margin of medical radiation and surgical that we have.\nSo, generally, the EBITDA margins are north of 35% in this, given that it is high\nintensity of radiotherapy, etc. also that we have. Neuro, again, the whole important\nthing is the ARPP on a neuro is typically higher, the average revenue per patient,\nwhich enables us to have a higher operating leverage, resulting in more than\nCompany margins. So, broadly, some of these are the reasons that if you saw our\nTranscript of AHEL Q3 FY25 Earnings Call Page 15 of 17",
        "So, Bangladesh, any foreign patients, we have been having some premium to be\nnormal, which is around 15% premium. So, that is how it has been.

So, we are quite hopeful that; we have the set of doctors\nthat's going to join in also. That is going to be oncology program as well in the new\nhospital. So, we are quite hopeful that we should be able to break that even in less\nthan 12 months. It's also in the heart of Delhi. In fact, it's a Defence Colony that we\nare starting.

So, is this now sustainable, we think, in terms of should we go\nback to our historical 6% to 7% kind of CAGR on ARPOB?

Just for my understanding how to build something for the next 3 years, I\nam not asking for a specific guidance as such.",

In\nprimary health clinic as well, we work closely with hospitals to look at opportunity to\nadd more clinics. So, these will be the formats, we'll be expanding.\nCurrently, coming to your question on margins. Currently, we are at a 9.2% EBITDA\nthis year. And we definitely, over a longer-term view, we should expect a 2-percentage\npoint in a year, at least to come in, and primarily being driven because of a stronger\ngrowth coming in from diagnostics and clinics, and the business mix changing more\ntowards Primary Care and diagnostics.",

        "Yes, thanks, Madhi, for this. So, yes, on the margin side, I think we have been steadily\nincreasing our margin. If you look at Q3 FY25, we are at about 13.8%, and\ncorresponding quarter FY24, it was 10.4%. We strongly believe that as we come\ncloser to Q2 end FY26 or Q3 FY26, when we intend to become breakeven. And as\nMadhivanan talked about insurance and various other value-added services to kick\nin, we should be hitting anything between 18% to 20% as a margin during that quarter\nto support the breakeven intent of the organization. So, that is where I would see that\nsteadily, we'll be increasing our margin quarter-on-quarter, and you can expect\nanything around 18% in next 3 to 4 quarters.",
        "Yes. We actually expect it to rationalize a little bit more, the new structure, maybe a\nlittle bit of a tweaking on our manpower cost. But at the same time, we will also be\ninvesting into the Insurance business. So, I would say the rate of deacceleration in\ncosts will come down. But it's not going to be a straight-line graph. So, we can expect\nthat we will try to get a much better return for the cost that we are already incurring.",
        "Yes, more or less around the current levels, because I don't intend to spend again on\nmarketing and any kind of variable expenses, so most of the fixed we will try to sweat\nit out more rather than that.",
        "Yes, I can take this question. So, we are looking at about INR 25,000 crore of revenue\nand about 6% to 7% of EBITDA in FY27. That's the guidance we have given. And if\nyou notice, earnings call deck, we have also given memo accounts and including\nKeimed. And you will notice that we are already at a run rate of roughly INR 17,000\ncrore with a 6.5% margin, if I exclude the digital losses, given the fact that digital\nlosses would become breakeven in next fiscal year, which is FY26.
