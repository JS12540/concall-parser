                "dialogue": "just a couple of questions. the first one is on yields. so while the interest reversals due to elevated slippages are understandable. but if you look at the corporate loan yields, they have been declining in the last 4 quarters sequentially. so what is the reason there? because we have been growing the small business loans faster than the large corporate. so that's question number one. and second question is on the asset quality. so even barring mfi, the npas in all other segments have inched up sequentially. and even the slippages in cfd is relatively elevated. so what's the outlook on the slippages in the coming quarters? those are my two questions."

            {
                "speaker": "Sumant Kathpalia",
                "dialogue": "so let me answer the first question on the corporate yields. if you look at the corporate yield, there are two reasons for it. one is, we manage our risk weights well. and that is important to us and also to make sure that the excess liquidity rather than going into the reverse repo, managed to move towards the good quality accounts with aa and aaa-rating. and that is where we are willing to give away yield. the weighted average risk weights have come down to 2.47 as explained earlier in the corporate book from 2.54 yoy. so we've actually managed our risk weights well. the second reason for that is the eblr repricing has happened on the loan book. so a lot of these corporate bank loans are floating rate loans. they're not fixed rate loans. and i think the eblr repricing where it's linked to external benchmark rates have got repriced. the second question was on how do you see the flows and i think it's too early to comment. like i told that our vehicle finance has gone through a turbulent period. and in good times, it gives you 110 to 120 basis points of credit cost and in bad time, gives you 130 to 140 basis points of credit costs. so, while the gross npa flows may look elevated, but the recovery in the vehicle finance book is relatively higher. and that is where i believe that the vehicle finance is a good book, which is managed in range bound credit cost. on the other retail loans, which has seen the flows is mainly because of the credit card business. and the credit card flows are at a higher level right now. you know the industry is going through a stress in the unsecured business. the good part is, they are now moderating. we've seen stability of forward flows now. and i think in the next 2 quarters, you should start seeing a reduction in the flows from the other retail book also. page 8 of 16 IndusInd Bank Limited\nJanuary 31, 2025\nOn micro finance, I will say that we have to continue to watch this space. The\nexplanation which we gave to Kunal stands here also, I continue to believe that the\nforward flows are now looking better. But I think we still have to be conservative and\ncautious about this space."

                "dialogue": "so there are multiple questions which you've asked. so let me try to address all your questions. the number one question is on what would be the share of mfi in your loan book. you've seen that over the past 3 years, we've been continuously reducing the share of the mfi. it was close to 13-14%, which is now gradually reduced to 9%. we want to keep it around to 8% to 10%. i think that is the optimal size of the mfi book. that's our first step. we are also diversifying our overall rural business. we continue to believe that rural is a great opportunity in the country, and we continue to diversify this book. we are also launching a segment called bharat vikas banking, which will house our rural focused businesses including merchant acquiring business, other bharat financial businesses and some other rural products such as small sme loans will also start getting launched in this vertical. we are diversifying this business from micro finance into bharat vikas banking so that we don't compromise on the growth of this segment. while it\u2019s given that the mfi business is cyclical in nature, we continue to believe that across cycles, mfi business should give you 2.5% to 3% roa. in some years, it can give you 4%, in some years it can give you 1.5% also. so i'm saying 2.5% to 3% roa across the cycle in this business. and if you look at this business on a holistic basis, i think it's an efficient business if done well. you need to keep buffer provisions in this business. i believe if you continue to keep 2% of the book as buffer provisions, you should be able to manage the stress. i've always said this book will run at a credit cost of towards 2.5% to 3.5%. you keep a 2% buffer provisions and in a cyclical trend, it should be able to take care by plus/minus 1%. that's how you should manage this business. i hope i have been able to answer your questions."

If I think about your branch franchise in number of Tier 2, Tier 3\ncities, Tier 4 cities, that granularity should be higher, but how that stable deposit\nnumber is a little low.
