        "dialogue": "good evening and thank you for joining this call. let me start with some macro commentary and then go into the bank specific details. recent trends in high-frequency indicators suggest stability in economic activity after the slowdown in q2. a recovery in rural demand and a festive season boost to urban demand is aiding to private consumption. however, a contraction in public capex in h1 and a sluggish recovery thereafter have weighed on investment growth. the union budget due to be presented tomorrow may address growth slowdown this year by retaining focus on investments on the spending side and continuing tax policy reforms to improve compliance while signalling commitment towards fiscal discipline. any potential measures supporting rural as well as overall economic activity should aid our microfinance and vehicle finance businesses. coming to the quarter specific developments, the key highlights for the quarter were: \uf0b7 robust retail deposit growth \u2013 we maintained momentum in retail deposit mobilisation during the quarter with 4% qoq and 14% yoy growth. the share of retail deposits as per lcr improved to 46.1% vs. 44.1% qoq. we, however, consciously let go some of the non lcr accretive wholesale deposits during the quarter and as a result, overall deposits declining 1% qoq. \uf0b7 calibrated loan growth \u2013 we continued to grow our loan book in calibrated manner being watchful of the developments across segments. overall loan growth was at 12% yoy and 3% qoq. our vehicle and microfinance businesses saw robust pick up in disbursements sequentially. momentum continued in other retail loans and corporate book growing 19% and 16% respectively. \uf0b7 progress on new initiatives \u2013 our liabilities initiatives of affluent and nri banking maintained healthy growth rates of 20% and 39% yoy respectively. loan book under merchant business at rs.6,319 crores grew 32% yoy while home loan book at rs.3,144 crores grew 128% yoy. our digital banking offering indie, is now opened up to all customers of the bank as the upgraded digital application and we are seeing positive trend amongst the early adopters. \uf0b7 asset quality \u2013 our gross npa & net npa were at 2.25% and 0.68% respectively. gross slippages were at rs.2,200 crores and net slippages were at rs.1,860 crores. the slippages were higher in microfinance segment given the industry situation. asset quality trends in rest of the businesses remained broadly stable. the restructured book, sma 1&2 loans and sr book saw improvement yoy and qoq. \uf0b7 ensured stability in financial metrics \u2013 our roa was stable at 1.03% vs 1.00% qoq. the lower nims due to rundown in microfinance book was offset by strong other income and cost control. our capital adequacy ratios remain healthy with cet1 at 15.18% and crar at 16.46%. page 2 of 16 IndusInd Bank Limited\nJanuary 31, 2025\nNow coming to individual businesses.\n1."

        "speaker": "Vehicle Finance",
        "dialogue": "\uf0b7 vehicle finance business saw improvement both in terms of disbursements and asset quality during the quarter. \uf0b7 vehicle disbursements for q3 were at rs.13,388 crores growing 25% qoq and almost at similar levels yoy. this quarter thus reversed the trend of yoy and qoq decline in disbursements in the last several quarters. \uf0b7 we saw yoy growth in disbursements for mhcv, construction equipments and two wheelers. passenger vehicles and scv saw yoy decline in disbursements. tractors and lcv too saw robust improvement sequentially, albeit it\u2019s still lower yoy. \uf0b7 the sequential vehicle loan growth thus accelerated to 3% from 1% last quarter. the yoy growth was at 9% broadly reflecting the underlying industry performance. \uf0b7 the gross slippages in vehicle finance were stable at 0.74% vs 0.73% yoy and 0.77% qoq. the commercial vehicles, passenger vehicles and construction equipments saw yoy and qoq improvement in slippages whereas tractors and 2-wheelers saw comparatively higher slippages. \uf0b7 the restructured book in vehicle finance continues to reduce at rs.231 crores vs rs.309 crores qoq with majority of the reduction coming from upgrades & recoveries. \uf0b7 overall, the vehicle industry should see recovery in volumes aided by government spends and possibly lower interest rate environment. with improved diversification across product categories, we remain well positioned to benefit once the industry sees recovery. 2. bharat financial inclusion limited (bfil): \uf0b7 outstanding loan book originated via bfil now stands at rs.38,883 crores growing by 1% qoq and down 4% yoy. \uf0b7 microfinance o microfinance segment witnessed sequential improvement in disbursements driven by pent-up demand as well as improving eligibility of centres as well as customers. o the disbursements of rs.9,200 crores were largely in line with the repayments and thus arresting sharp drop in the loan book witnessed since march-24. o we remain cautious on the growth with disbursements well below our historical runrates as well as customer eligibility. geographically, amongst the key states, portfolio grew sequentially in maharashtra and odisha whereas degrew in karnataka and uttar pradesh. o the 30-90 dpd book was stable at 4.0% vs 4.1% qoq. o we have provided a few additional disclosures on microfinance covering disbursement as well as asset quality indicators. the disbursements are concentrated towards vintage customers and centers. the incremental stress in microfinance seems to be peaking out as seen in reducing forward flows from 0-dpd customers. we can discuss these further in q&a. \uf0b7 bharat super shop i.e. the merchant acquiring business o we have now around 660k merchant borrowers under this program. page 3 of 16 IndusInd Bank Limited\nJanuary 31, 2025\no Our merchant loan book at Rs.6,319 crores grew by 32% YoY & 9%\nQoQ.\n\uf0b7 The share of non-MFI book improved to 16% vs 12% YoY.\n\uf0b7 Total liabilities sourced through BFIL now stand at Rs.2,610 crores with 19mn\nSA and RD accounts.\n\uf0b7 Gross slippages from BFIL increased to Rs.695 crores during the quarter.\n\uf0b7 We remain committed to the business with investment on technology and\nanalytics as well as human resources adding around 10,000 more employees\nduring last one year in BFIL.\nOverall, while incremental stress formation is showing early signs of stability, we\ncontinue to be cautious on the microfinance segment. We are also watchful of\nimplications from the new MFIN guidelines once they get implemented.\nNevertheless, we continue to believe in our approach of addressing focusing on\n1) funding requirements of vintage customers and centres, 2) being conservative\non overall customer industry indebtedness, 3) investing in collection\ninfrastructure and 4) continued diversification of the loan book.\n3."
