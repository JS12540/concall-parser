Ltd. January 17, 2025\nBut broadly, if you ask me, in terms of the overall loss ratio range that\nI have spoken about even in the past, and again, as I keep saying, it's\nalways better to look at motor as a category, rather than looking at\nown damage and third-party independently. The range that we have\nspoken about running overall motor in that range of 65% to 67%, I\nthink that's broadly the range that we believe we should continue to\nsee as an outcome in terms of the portfolio experience. So that's\nwhere we are.\nThe positive news is, some of the market participants possibly who\nhad gone quite aggressive in the past, you can clearly see most of\nthose companies when you look at their individual month \u2013on month\ngrowth numbers, clearly, there has been an element of calibration\nthat has happened. That's also reflective in the outcomes that these\ncompanies had to exhibit in some of their Combined ratio outcomes.\nSo that's where we are. We continue to be cautious in building the\nbook and so far as the ethos on writing or selecting the portfolios\ncontinues to remain the same. As in, we will keep looking for on a\nsustained basis economic output, which we think will be viable from\na longer-term perspective."

Ltd. January 17, 2025\nincreased incidences of claims playing out in the context of the\nHealth segment specifically. Therefore, in line with what we have\nspoken even in quarter 1, we said we will obviously observe for the\ndevelopment of this increased incidences over the next few quarters.\nSo that's where we are and in that context is where the numbers are\nfor the health loss numbers.\nTo your last point on Motor, the range that we spoke about at 65%\nto 67%, you're absolutely right. That's obviously the preferred range\nat which we would want to run the book again, not just over a 1 or\n2 year horizon, that's something that we would want to look at it\nover a much more long-term play. Having said that, obviously, now\nwhen it comes to specific financial periods, it could be purely a\nfunction of what mix of business that you write. Again, we have\ndiscussed this in the past, particularly when it comes to new motor,\nthat typically comes with a relatively low loss outcome, but possibly\na slightly higher cost of acquisition. But equally, on the fixed side,\nwhen you start to source more of the renewal or the older book, that\ninvariably comes with a slightly higher loss outcome, but obviously a\nlower cost of acquisition. So that's how we manage the overall\nportfolio in the way how we see the market opportunity. But over a\nmedium to long term, the range that we are comfortable with to\noperate with will be between 65% to 67% for Motor as a category."

January 17, 2025\nSo, in general, I think, again, on the Retail Indemnity book specifically,\nyou had spoken about the fact that the range that we are\ncomfortable on running the book is a loss ratio of around that range\nbetween 65% to 70%, more towards, I would say, slightly on the\nhigher end of the range. At this point of time, as you would have seen\nthe outcome largely is playing out within the range that we are\ncomfortable with.

Again, this is something that all of you understand, it's\nalways, in that sense, given the fact that Motor own damage is free\nto price, Motor third-party is fixed and tariff. Better to look at motor\nas a category, rather than trying to even split between motor own\ndamage and third-party.

Ltd. January 17, 2025\nback, when the regulator has mandated third-party mandatory for 3\nyears, 5 years, in between there were changes in terms of the\nproduct construct to get Motor line of business recognized on a 1/n\nprescription, similar to what you see for the rest of the lines as we\nspeak today. So those practices, obviously, evolve over a period of\ntime. Hence, we will obviously watch the market developments very,\nvery closely.

Ltd. January 17, 2025\nin the market. Rather than the obligatory reinsurance, we don't have\nany other reinsurance requirements from a Health Indemnity\nstandpoint.\nOn Health Benefit as a category, not just again this year, across\nyears, we have obviously operated on a reinsurance structure. If you\nrecollect, particularly not just against this quarter, this year, in\ngeneral, the Health Benefit segment has seen an impact on growth.\nTherefore, to that extent, that will obviously have an impact on the\nnet retention numbers. So that's one.\nSecond, for whatever it is, even Quarter 3 does have an element of\nCorporate Business as well. It's not that Corporate Business comes\ndown to zero. There, the approach for us, again, if you look at it over\na 9-month basis, we have been very selective. Largely, we have tried\nto hold on to maintaining market share in that particular category.\nAlso, given the fact that, that particular business is slightly in that\nsense subdued, that again contributes to the overall retention\nnumbers. But if you see the overall retention numbers, the way we\nlook at it on a net premium to gross premium, I think at least if you\nlook at it on a 9 month basis in the current year, if you look at it even\nwith the 1/n impact, I think the retention number will be roughly at\nabout 72%. I think that's where we are. To answer your point, no\nchange in the reinsurance strategy, nothing specific. It's not a case\nwhere we had an element of reinsurance for the first 6 months or\nsomething, and suddenly we have decided to change our approach\nto reinsurance. No significant change therein.

Ltd. January 17, 2025\nunder the with 1/n impact. So is it fair to conclude that your\ncommissions are lower, because of deferrals under 1/n method and\nthat's what is resulting in higher profits?"

                "dialogue": "subramanian, again, which is why i responded to say that the prescription under 1/n need not necessarily be, in terms of outcome, go in the direction of only an increase in profits. because again, this will be a function of what business mix that you source, what is the reinsurance structures that you may have in practice, and what is the acquisition cost that you relate to, with respect to sourcing any of those businesses. so there are multiple factors which will drive, let's say, an outcome when you look at it from a transition to a 1/n slash without a 1/n outcome. now talking specific in the context of quarter 3, i think obviously this has been a quarter where we were just talking about. in general, i think the credit-linked disbursement across financial institutions have clearly been muted. and obviously, to that extent, and we have been one of the key writers of some of those risks. that's an area where i said, we have always been historically operating also with the reinsurance structure. the fact that the business growth has been relatively subdued, obviously, that does have an impact, both in terms of growth in premiums, and therefore, correspondingly the impact that it has. i mean when you look at it, 1/n, effectively, the prescription is to say that whatever acquisition costs that you incur, you defer it over the contract period. similarly, if there's an element of reinsurance income that you may have, that is something, again, you defer it over the policy contract. so in a quarter, if you do see businesses where you already had an element of a reinsurance arrangement, and if that business gets subdued, and therefore, the relative impact in outcome will not page 25 of 35 ICICI Lombard General Insurance Co. Ltd. January 17, 2025\nnecessarily be the same as compared to a line of business, for\nexample, in Quarter 3, we also have contracts of other lines of\nbusinesses, where we don't have a reinsurance arrangement, but\nthere's a cost of acquisition and by this very inherent nature of a\ntransition to 1/n, the cost gets deferred. There is nothing in terms of\nincome for us to defer over the policy period, leave aside the\nobligatory. That's a very small component. So that's the reason why\nyou see an outcome for Quarter 3 in terms of profits to be higher than\nwhat you would have normally reported on without 1/n approach.\nNow this can change. Going ahead, if let's say, the proportion of mix\nof businesses undergo a change in terms of the various factors that\nI spoke, the outcome could be either reverse. You could possibly see\na situation of neutrality in terms of no change in profits or equally,\nyou could see maybe an outcome similar to what we are seeing for\nQuarter 3 this year. So lot of moving parts. Hence, to that extent, very\ndifficult to attribute any specific reasons, but Quarter 3, this is the\nreason. It has been more businesses which are long term are the\nones where there are only cost of acquisitions to be amortized, but\nrelatively, there are no reinsurance commissions to be done."

Ltd. January 17, 2025\nTo your point on what would be the outcome on Quarter 4 Combined,\nand maybe, let's say, as we get into the next financial year, I think\nSanjeev already responded to that in response to one of the earlier\nquestions. I think again, as we keep saying, let's say, when we look\nat Quarter 4, two factors. One, we obviously have to wait and see\nhow the environment plays. So, to that extent, that's a variable.\nSecond, we will have to see how the market responds. I think what\nwe have said, our combined will, again, be in relation to the industry\noutcomes. At least the first half seems to indicate that the market is\nslightly more adverse, compared to 111%, it's at about 113%. So\nwe'll wait and see how Quarter 3 numbers are for the other players\nin the market and corresponding to that is how our own Quarter 4\noutcomes will play out.\nBut what we are conscious of, I think in all fairness, when we look at\nmaybe just the return on equity to stakeholders, I think the broad\ncomfort that we can give you is we should definitely end the year\nwithin that range of about 16% to 18%. As we head into the next\nyear, the approach to writing risk will still remain the same, and then\nwe will keep looking for profitable opportunities."

                "dialogue": "i'll give you a small perspective. so clearly, you'll get a better understanding of what gopal also is talking about it. if you look at our last year number, even before that, commercial business for us was clearly doing a very good growth numbers and you know that commercial business overarchingly worked in a combined ratio which is far lower. so when we started working on the planning for this year itself, we had a belief that commercial line per se remains secular on the contribution, which is what gopal also alluded in this conversation. as things stand, it's not commercial line which has grown, but the retail line of business which we're talking about, also retail indemnity that was motor line of business which has given us growth. when the configuration changes, it's pertinent to page 28 of 35 ICICI Lombard General Insurance Co. Ltd. January 17, 2025\nunderstand that the combined ratio will also change. But the overall\nvalue that we want to give the stakeholder may not get impacted at\nall. So the obsession with Combined ratio, I do understand from your\nangle. But how we look at businesses has to be understood in a far\nmore comprehensive manner to give a particular level of targeted\nROE. There will be changes. If we had stuck to the same plan, maybe\nwe wouldn't have done what is required on Retail, and still stuck to\na low growing growth. So we would have done a much lesser top\nline as well as shown a better combined, but it would not have\nserved the purpose.\nSo the point that Gopal keeps making is, look at the business in a far\nmore comprehensive manner. We will have to stay agile in terms of\nwhat opportunities get provided. While we do give guidance and we\ndid speak about it, we don't want to get ourselves tied down because\nwe have had \u201cX\" combined number, we will let go an opportunity,\nwhich will serve us much better in long term. It's an overarching\nthought which I want to put across and why we'll have to also real\ntime change our plans as the market forces us to react to it."

January 17, 2025\nat 20% ROEs, and combined ratios are trending closer to 100%, I\nmean, we are still 200 bps away, do you think there could be a\nrecalibration to that target in the medium term?"

Third will be, again, given\nthe fact that we are driving a lot more of Retail Health, so that\ninvariably comes with a slightly higher cost of acquisition. So multiple\nmoving parts.
