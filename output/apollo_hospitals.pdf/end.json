        "dialogue": "two quick questions. sir, how are you looking at the industry supply curve, incremental supply additions, say, for fy '25, '26, '27? the reason is more to understand from a pricing perspective, given there is so much of supply, how are you looking at the marketplace."

        "speaker": "Ajay Kapur",
        "dialogue": "so, ritesh, i would answer it in a little different way. today, india is -- i think by the time we finish this current financial year, we will hit more like 450 million, 460 million demand and maybe closer to 700 million total capacities, of which the capacity which can produce cement would be 100 million tons lower. now if india grows at about 8%, so 8% on 450 million or 500 million is close to 30 million tons, which basically means you need to add 2.5 million tons additional volume either from the existing, the base or add new capacity. i think at 300 per capita, india being the second largest market, gdp still sub $3,000, inching towards $5,000 in the next couple of years. all this will translate into more housing demand, more infra demand, which is largely led by government. and i think the commercial demand about 15%, all of them will have their own growth trajectory. the question is if the industry does not responsibly add new capacity today, which is totally private sector investments today and totally based on free competition, consumers will end up paying prices which will be much, much higher. so, i think it's in the interest of the nation that you build cement at a lower cost, you are able to produce cement at a lower cost. and the companies which are able to command brand premiums like the ones fortunate for me to run, ambuja, acc, which are top end, which command at least inr30 to inr40 premium over the category b, c players, i think this is a good place to be in. there will be times when demand supply does not match. unfortunately, current year h1, the demand after growing a very healthy 7%, 8% for the first time went almost flattish. and that, alongside the new capacity creation, created a short-term sentiment pressure, which i believe will get adjusted because nobody will be able to manage the investments without requisite returns. and i think that's why the price situations will remain better in time to come."

        "speaker": "Ritesh Shah",
        "dialogue": "sir, that's helpful. but would it be possible for you to qualify what is the expected industry level additions that you are looking at internally? so, for '26, '27, based on our numbers, we are looking at 50 million tons plus and hence, the rate what you indicated at 8% won't be adequate to cover up for incremental supply, which puts some pressure on pricing profitability in the near term. so, is that fair? or you're looking at it in a different view?"

        "speaker": "Ajay Kapur",
        "dialogue": "i'm sure when you do your models as part of your analyst reports, you don't put 100% capacity of any company in year 1, right? you ramp it up, if 50 million is coming, if you can take 40% to 50% coming in year 1, then you're already removing 25 million to 30 million, which will come most likely at different months during the period and full effect of that will come only over the next 2 years. so, i think that's what has happened in the past. that's what is going to happen in future also."

        "speaker": "Ritesh Shah",
        "dialogue": "sure. sir, my second question was, how do you look at the industry cost curve? we have given a bold number of inr530. we are actually walking the talk over there. so one is, how do you page 17 of 20"

        "speaker": "Ajay Kapur",
        "dialogue": "so, let me answer the first one, which is more to do with me. see, i cannot comment on whether i'll be in the pole position versus others. every company, i'm sure, is working very hard. what we are doing, we have stated very clearly quarter after quarter in all our website posts of our analyst calls, i think you'll see this very clear number. there are clear initiatives, whether it is logistics, whether it is power and fuel, whether it's other fixed costs, whether it is brand building and marketing and whether it is going green. as i mentioned, we'll hit 83% green. that will reduce my power cost to inr3.50. and that's a substantial reduction from the current grid cost of inr8. likewise, with own coal mines over the next couple of years, it takes time because many of the coal mines are underground mines. the coal cost itself will drop down, and it will take me out of the vagaries of day-to-day bidding and buying out in auction premiums. so, i think that i think inr500 is a very clear visibility because it's directly. each initiative has an action, it has a capex, and it has an opex. what others will do, i cannot comment. i would continue to believe that in the next 5 years, adani cement would not just be the lowest cost in india, but perhaps it will compete with the lowest cost in china, which is the world, first part. second part regarding 2030, yes, there are a few plants for us, which will have some residual limestone. they would be, in maharashtra one plant, in madhya pradesh one plant, and i think mostly in chhattisgarh one plant and in himachal one plant. we are making a lot of initiatives, speaking with the government. iindustry is also working through various forums, niti aayog, etcetera. a little early in the day to comment, but i think who knows. we might also get some respite from the government for that."
