We\nwill be able to give you the exact numbers around March. So, just bear with us in this\nquarter, but all the necessary formalities are done, and we should be able to take it\nup. More than the GMV, this has helped our margin expansion in a much bigger way,\nbecause insurance as a business, because we'll be focusing on retail, health\ninsurance and retail term. The margin percentages in these kind of products is\nreasonably large."

We hope to again expand that\ndramatically. So, between these 3 businesses, which are our core business, we are\nreasonably confident of doing around 20% growth rate. I'll come to the margins\nseparately. The Insurance business, which we hope to begin in the coming year,\nwould start maybe a bit slowly, but by the end of Q3, we should have a recurring\nrevenue, which will be contribution to the margin structure. They might not support us\non the growth, but on the revenue side, it would be a big flow. For margin, can I ask\nSanjiv as to how the margin structure will play out, please?"
