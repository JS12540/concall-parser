        "dialogue": "thank you and a warm welcome to everybody, to all our investors, analysts, funds, whoever are taking the time out and participating in today's q3 earnings call of adani total gas. i am pleased to share the operational and the financial results for atgl for the quarter and the nine-month ending 31st december 2024. let me begin with the physical highlights for the quarter. our cng station network has increased to 605 stations. we have added 58 stations for the year and for the quarter under results, we have added 28 new cng stations. of these 605 cng stations, 116 cng stations are codos or dodos in terms of their format. our steel pipeline infra has now increased to 13,082-inch kilometers. on the domestic pipe natural gas connections, atgl is now serving over 9,22,000 domestic homes on pipe natural gas. for the year of nine months, we have added over a lakh connection and for the quarter ending december, we have added 28,677 connections. similarly, for the industrial and commercial consumers, we have now reached 8,913 consumers by adding 582 connections for the nine-month period, whilst we have added 167 for the quarter third. let me also give you an update on some of the other newer emerging businesses. on the e-mobility front, we are now at 1,914 ev charging points that have been commissioned across 22 states 4 union territory, in all 226 cities and we aim to reach around 3,000 charging points by march to april this year. our presence of our ev charging points now has increased to almost 20 airports in the country. in fact, we are one of the largest airport ev charge point operator at this juncture. on the biomass business, atbl had commenced production and sales of the cbg from our barsana plant and we are hoping to enhance the same along with fermented organic manure, fom, or the phosphate-rich organic manure, prom, soon in the future. on the lng side, our ltm business, we have commenced the first lng station for long-haul trucks and buses in tirupur and tamil nadu and a few more are at various stages of progress for page 2 of 12 Adani Total Gas Limited\nJanuary 27, 2025\ncommissioning. Let me also share with you the financial numbers for the quarter. During this\nquarter, the CGD industry faced a couple of reductions in the APM allocation.\nSo was the case for ATGL. The first reduction was on the 16th of October 2024 when our APM\ngas was reduced from 63% to 51%. We once again faced a second round of APM reduction from\nthe 51% to 37% on the 16th of November 2024.\nTherefore, on an average basis for the quarter, the APM allocation for the CNG segment\nspecifically was at 47%. This shortfall with the agility of ATGL was met through our existing\ncontracts, purchase of gas from the IGX spot market, as well as coupled with the allocation of\nthe New Well gas from the government and which allowed us to supply gas on a continuous\nbasis. Like always, our focus has been to calibrate the end prices, balancing the affordability of\nend consumers and other stakeholders, including the profitability of the company.\nAnd I am pleased to say that despite such challenges, ATGL maintained its growth trajectory,\nfocusing on a customer-centric approach and delivered a robust operational performance with a\nnotable 15% growth in volumes on a year-on-year comparable basis, of which the CNG volume\nincreased by 19% to 171 MMSCM, whilst the PNG volume increased by 8% to 86 MMSCM\nduring the quarter. Similarly, on a Q-on-Q basis, our volumes continued to rise by close to 6%.\nSo, the balance was formed in terms of continuing to push volume growth whilst ensuring that\nthere is a right price pass-through mechanism to the end consumers.\nOn the financial front, for the third quarter, as compared to the previous quarter on a Y-o-Y\nbasis, revenues from operations increased by 12% to INR1,397 crores. Due to a reduction in\nAPM allocation and the increase in gas price, EBITDA for the quarter has been at INR272\ncrores, while our PBT and PAT was at INR193 crores and INR143 crores, respectively.\nRecently, with effect from 16th January 2025, APM allocation for CNG has increased from 37%\nto 51% and we expect to see some positive impact in this case in the current quarter that is going\nby. We are closely assessing the situation regarding the availability of APM gas also going\nforward.\nIn closing, I would like to say we remain committed to playing a leading role in India's energy\ntransition journey by providing affordable, reliable, low-carbon energy for homes,\ntransportation, commercial and industrial users. I would also like to acknowledge and be\nthankful to all our shareholders, stakeholders, analysts, funds, houses, consumers, dealers,\nsuppliers, business partners and all our employees for providing trust and continued support.\nThank you very much. We could open the floor for questions and answers."
