What are the key factors contributing to the CNG volume growth? And if you could\nprovide how many vehicles on a daily basis you are supplying at CNG, it would be helpful?"

                "dialogue": "no, i understood your question. see, first of all, we need to understand that the vision of a government on cgd expansion and the development remains strong. so, this is one thing. so, that is the reason when the gas allocation went down or several constraints what government was working it out. what they did? while the apm allocation went down, they brought a solution of a new well gas, which has a priority for the cgd. similarly, we have hthp allocation as a priority for a cgd. higher prices, but there is a priority even though the spot prices may be much, much higher, but cgd are being given. so, that these actions will tell you that government has a strong vision for a continual development of a cgd sector. now, it has gone to 51% with certain measures which government took. now, what measures they are taking? that the lpg plant, the operators, and who are also the large like gail and ongc, they are actually taking the apm gas, which was part of a priority for extraction of lpg and the lean gas was being given to us. government view was that, since cgd has a first priority, let even that part be currently given benefit to the cgd. that is only rational because they saw that cgd's allocation has come down significantly to 37%-38%. so, that would put a lot of pressure on us at this winter period that we have to bridge the gap with a very high price gas. so, government had in mind that affordability of end consumers page 5 of 12 Adani Total Gas Limited\nJanuary 27, 2025\nshould also be balanced. So, I think keeping in mind affordability of end consumers balancing,\nalso seeing that which other areas government could help CGD sector is what is being done.\nSo, that is the reason the 51% gas has been restored. Now, other industries so far has not been\nrestored. Only LPG part has been restored, plus the new well gas is being given to us. That is\nthe only current update we have. What we also understand from government that government is\ncontinually working on one, how much more APM gas could be given to CGD from what all\nmeasures could be taken, either industrial allocation or any other location.\nSecond, what other help government could extend on supply chain aspect because we also have\nsupply chain cost. So, I think there is a continuous engagement which is currently in place to\nmake sure that there is a balancing approach on CGD gas, APM restoration or supply chain cost\noptimization. Similarly, ensuring that, like for example, if new well gas is coming, that also gets\nallocated to CGD."
