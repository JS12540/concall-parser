## Data model of model responses

### Details 
(extracted from management speech, for current period)

List of dicts, where each dict is structured as:
- metric: the figure, number or percentage for current period
- context: geographic, product line or industry wise
- importance: numeric score

------------------------

### Outlook
(How the management feels about future prospects, where to improve, scale down)

List of text seems most appropriate, however we can add numbers for sorting by the score.
