# Concall Parser

**Concall Parser** is an open-source Python library designed to efficiently extract insights from earnings call (concall) transcripts. It enables seamless extraction of management commentary, analyst discussions, company information, and more.

## üì¶ Installation

Install the library using pip:

```bash
pip install concall-parser
```


## Usage

You can initialize the ConcallParser either with a local PDF path or directly via a URL to the concall document.

### Using a Local PDF

```python
from concall_parser.parser import ConcallParser

parser = ConcallParser(path="path/to/concall.pdf")
```

### Using a PDF Link

```python
from concall_parser.parser import ConcallParser

parser = ConcallParser(link="https://www.bseindia.com/xml-data/corpfiling/AttachHis/458af4e6-8be5-4ce2-b4f1-119e53cd4c5a.pdf")
```

## Configuration

The library leverages GROQ for core NLP tasks such as intent classification. To use GROQ, ensure the following environment variables are set:

```bash
export GROQ_API_KEY="YOUR GROQ API KEY"
export GROQ_MODEL="YOUR GROQ MODEL NAME"
```

We by default use llama3-70b-8192 if any groq supported models are not provided.
